"1R01HD091731-01","SOURCE OF THE PLACENTAL MICROBIOME","AAGAARD, KJERSTI MARIE","AAGAARD, KJERSTI MARIE","Human-associated microorganisms (the “microbiome”) are present in numbers exceeding the quantities of
human cells by at least 10-fold, and the collective genome (the “metagenome”) exceeds our human genome
in terms of gene content by more than 150-fold. We and others have recently demonstrated that bacteria are
detected in the placenta using a variety of culturable and non-culturable approaches. For several years we
have developed and employed metagenomics to characterize the placental microbiome, and observed
variation in its community membership and their function by virtue of gestational age at delivery. However, it
remains unknown what the different maternal source(s) are of the placental microbiome, and whether it sinks
to the fetus via the intra-amniotic cavity and thus is measureable in amniotic fluid.
 In response to the Human Placental Project, we propose to identify the sources and sinks for and of the
placental microbiome employing two large, robust and well characterized existing datasets. We will generate
unparalleled metagenomics and metabolomics data, in order to test our central hypothesis that the placenta is
populated by commensal microbiota which largely arise from the maternal oral and GI communities, with a
lesser contribution from the vagina. We further hypothesize that placental microbes populate the fetus and the
intrauterine environment, and are detectable in mid-trimester amniotic fluid. Moreover, their metabolites serve
as lasting signatures of the microbiotas functional presence.
 In order to prove this hypothesis, we will execute three essential aims in a total of over 1230 subjects
samples from two existing data sets. The net result of the completion of these aims will be to first identify the
maternal source of the placental microbiota, and validate these findings using state of the art single molecule
fluorescent in situ hybridization and culturation. We will thereafter recapitulate these findings in early and mid-
second trimester amniotic fluid and thus identify the early evidence of the placental microbiota sink. In a final
aim, we will use LC/MS full spectral metabolomics on these same subjects samples to identify the stable and
lasting metabolic footprint of the microbiome. We present our proof of concept work on intrahepatic cholestasis
of pregnancy as evidence for the feasibility, significance and ready translational application of our approach.
 As a proven team of perinatal physician scientists with an emphasis and history of being at the forefront of
big data (and notably metagenomics) science, we are uniquely poised to now undertake complex integration of
these unique data sets in studies which are feasible, justifiable, and of likely long-term significance and high
impact.","This application from a proven team with a history of being at the forefront of perinatal metagenomics, we are
uniquely poised to now identify the maternal source and intrauterine sink of the placental microbiome.
Deciphering these processes will provide insights into the role of microbiota, particularly commensal
microbes, in human pregnancies. Our commitment and experience in enabling “team science” approaches
applied to placental biology and pregnancy health and disease will enable application of our findings for the
common good.","Amniocentesis; amniotic cavity; Amniotic Fluid; Bacteria; base; Bayesian Modeling; Big Data; Birth; Cells; Chorionic villi; clinical Diagnosis; Clinical Management; cohort; Cohort Studies; commensal microbes; Common Good; Communities; Complex; Data; data integration; Data Science; Data Set; Data Sources; Disease; Environment; Etiology; experience; Feces; Fetus; Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization; Funding; Generations; Genes; Genome; Genotype; Gestational Age; Goals; Health; Human; Human Genome; insight; intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy; Knowledge; Label; light microscopy; Linear Models; liquid chromatography mass spectrometry; Mass Fragmentography; Measures; Metabolic; metabolome; metabolomics; metagenome; metagenomic sequencing; Metagenomics; Microbe; microbial community; microbiome; microbiota; microorganism; Modeling; Nuclear; Oral; oral microbiome; Perinatal; petabyte; Phenotype; Physicians; Placenta; Placental Biology; Placental microbiome; predictive signature; Pregnancy; Premature Birth; Process; Recording of previous events; response; Ribosomal RNA; Risk; Role; Sampling; Science; Scientist; Second Pregnancy Trimester; Shotguns; single molecule; Source; Structure; Symbiosis; Taxonomy; Testing; Time; tool; United States National Institutes of Health; Vagina; vaginal microbiome; Variant; whole genome; Whole-Genome Shotgun Sequencing; Work"

Human-associated microorganisms (the ""microbiome"") are present in numbers exceeding the quantities of human cells by at least 10-fold beginning in the neonatal period The collective genome (the ""metagenome"") exceeds our human genome in terms of gene content by more than 150-fold. With respect to microbiota and preterm birth, it has generally assumed that the majority of intrauterine infections originate in the lower genital tract, with microbiota ascending into the otherwise sterile intrauterine environment to infect the placenta (preterm birth), fetal membranes (chorioamnionitis), umbilical cord (funisitis), and the fetus (sepsis). However, we and others have recently demonstrated that (1) the vaginal and gut microbiome communities are distinctly structured in pregnancy, and (2) the placenta is in fact not sterile, but rather harbors a low-abundance microbiome which is likely acquired through hematogenous transmission of the oral microbiome. Based on our prior studies and preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that a distinct and largely commensal resident microbiome in pregnancy renders risk for preterm birth. In order to prove this hypothesis, we will execute three essential aims: Aim 1 will use 16S-based approaches with inferred metagenomics employing samples from at-risk gravidae enrolled at <20 weeks gestation to reveal distinct microbial communities which occur in association with preterm birth; Aims 2&3 will use whole-genome shotgun sequencing with integrated host genomics, metatranscriptomics, and metabolomics to build on our functional computational pipelines and enable species identification, microbial gene catalogues, metabolic reconstructions, and mechanisms and networks of susceptibility to preterm birth. In addition, we describe our concomitant efforts to build a community resource for future large-scale studies on host and microbe biomarkers acquired in this set of preterm, near term, and term births. By utilizing our state-of-the-science technology and analysis tools in a longitudinal case-cohort of preterm birth subjects, we will be able to transform ""discovery based"" metagenomics and multi'omics science into readily translatable mechanistic studies at a previously unparalleled level.

 Project Summary
The University of the South Pacific (USP) is the major educational vehicle serving 12 lower income island
nations in the South Pacific region. The Center for Drug Discovery and Conservation (CDDC) at the USP was
founded as part of this ICBG program and provides advanced graduate student training in diverse subjects
including marine natural products chemistry, microbiology, drug discovery, and marine conservation. The
CDDC is the central resource through which all ICBG activities will occur. The CDDC will continue to facilitate
interactions with local and government officials and subsequent collection activities. CDDC personnel will
continue to provide local field expertise and preliminary taxonomic analyses of algal and invertebrate samples.
Major research activities will include the participation in ecology-guided natural product discovery in
collaboration with other associate programs. Our researchers will perform bioassay-guided fractionation of
prioritized algal and invertebrate extracts and assist with the structure elucidate of active compounds. The
CDDC will take an increased role in the marine microbiology program, leveraging valuable experience gained
from prior ICBG funding to assemble a diverse and chemically rich collection of cultured marine bacteria.
Extracts generated from these bacteria will serve as the source material for the microbial drug discovery
efforts. Technology transfer and training are important components of this program and include personnel
visiting Scripps and Georgia Institute of Technology for advanced training in natural products chemistry and
marine microbiology, respectively. Training and scientific exchange will also occur during regular visits by
associate program participants to the USP and during taxonomy and benefit sharing workshops organized by
the CDDC. The CDDC will work with marine ecologists to develop more effective strategies for reef
conservation and to expand the Locally-Managed Marine Area (LMMA) program, which has proven to be a
highly effective method to bring village-level awareness to the importance of conservation and the
maintenance of healthy coral reefs. A long-term goal of this program is to further enhance the capabilities of
the CDDC as vibrant center for conservation and drug discovery and to ensure that it will continue to provide
these important functions long after ICBG funding has ended.","Actinomyces Infections; Agar; Agreement; Antibiotics; Area; Attitude; Awareness; Back; Bacteria; base; benefit sharing; Biodiversity; Biological; Biological Assay; Biological Preservation; Chemicals; Chemistry; Collaborations; Collection; Communities; coral; cytotoxic; cytotoxicity; Development; drug discovery; drug resource; Ecology; Education; Educational workshop; Ensure; experience; experimental study; Fermentation; Fiji; Fishes; Fractionation; Funding; Future; Generations; Genome; Geographic Locations; Goals; Government Officials; graduate student; Habitats; Harvest; Health; Human Resources; Income; Institutes; Institution; International; invertebrate host; Invertebrates; Island; Lead; Libraries; Local Government; Low income; Maintenance; marine natural product; Marines; Methods; microbial; Microbiology; Mining; Modernization; Molecular; Natural Product Drug; Natural Products; Natural Products Chemistry; new technology; Oceanography; operation; Participant; Phylogenetic Analysis; Play; Policies; Population; Preparation; Process; Production; programs; Protocols documentation; Psychological Transfer; Research; Research Activity; Research Personnel; Research Support; Resource Sharing; Resources; Role; sample collection; Sampling; screening; Secure; Site; Solomon Islands; Source; Standardization; Stress; Structure; student training; Surface; Surveys; Taxonomy; Techniques; Technology; technology training; Technology Transfer; Testing; tool; Training; Transcend; Transcription Factor AP-1; Transcription Factor AP-2 Alpha; Universities; Vanuatu; Visit; Work",NA
"5R01HS024296-02","THE IMPACT OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT AMONG ADOLESCENT OFFENDERS","AALSMA, MATTHEW","AALSMA, MATTHEW","It is well established that youth offenders suffer mental health and substance abuse disorders at
disproportionately high rates when compared to youth in the community without any history of justice
system involvement. In efforts to rehabilitate delinquent youth and prevent criminal recidivism,
policymakers and researchers have developed and implemented evidence-based behavioral health
treatments specific to offenders. However, the research literature has rarely confirmed that such
services actually reduce criminal recidivism among adolescent offenders, especially when services for a
range of behavioral health needs are considered. Previous studies, moreover, have not quantified the
frequency, duration, and type of behavioral health service utilization most likely to improve
delinquency-related outcomes.
Therefore, the primary objective of this project is to assess whether adequate episodes of behavioral
health treatment reduce criminal recidivism among a large population of adolescent offenders. To
accomplish our objective, our interdisciplinary research team will prepare and analyze the justice
system and electronic health records (EHR) of more than 150,000 youth from Marion County
(Indianapolis), Indiana. The resulting 15-year retrospective, longitudinal analytic database will include
youth with a wide array of experiences in both the behavioral health and criminal justice systems. We
expect that more than one third of sampled youth will have a juvenile criminal record, including more
than 40,000 youth with records from their first encounter with the justice system (i.e., first arrest). In
this way, we will capture a variety of developmental stages, behavioral health diagnoses, criminal
charges, and pathways through both the behavioral health and justice systems.
We will create and to analyze a comparison group of community youth (i.e., non-offenders), in order to
strengthen our understanding of adolescent behavioral health utilization patterns. By employing
existing performance measures of treatment quality for adequate behavioral health treatment, we will
highlight meaningful differences in service utilization between offenders and community youth, and
within the group of offenders. We expect that differences in the timing and intensity of behavioral
health care utilization among offenders will affect whether and how treatment reduces recidivism.
Lastly, we will assess the role that delinquency case dispositions (i.e., conditions of probation) play in
the relationship between behavioral health service utilization and criminal recidivism. Specific aims
include:
Aim 1. Compare the behavioral health treatment needs and behavioral health service
utilization of youth offenders to those of community youth.
Aim 2. Test the relationship between behavioral health service utilization and criminal
recidivism among youth offenders.
There is a substantial cost of juvenile criminal behavior to society. We expect to quantify if BH
treatment reduces criminal recidivism. The long-term goal of this project is to identify specific points
along the continuum of justice system involvement (e.g., arrest, detention, incarceration, and transfer
to adult court) where utilization of behavioral health services will have the most impact in reducing
criminal recidivism.","Project Narrative
The impact of behavioral health treatment among adolescents on criminal justice outcomes will be studied to inform

"5R01DA038466-03","TESTING THE LEADERSHIP AND ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE FOR IMPLEMENTATION (LOCI) INTERVENTION IN SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT PROGRAMS","AARONS, GREGORY","AARONS, GREGORY","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Effective implementation of evidence-based practices (EBPs) to address complex and widespread public health issues, such as substance use disorders (SUDs) and HIV, remains a substantial challenge. Leadership and organizational context are associated with implementation climate and attitudes toward EBP, as well as clinical outcomes such as client satisfaction and quality of life. While there are many leadership development approaches, they are often not based on empirically supported approaches and curricula, nor are they specifically designed to develop strategic climates for EBP implementation. This project addresses these concerns and advances implementation science by testing the effects of the Leadership and Organizational Change for Implementation (LOCI) intervention. The goals of the LOCI intervention are to improve general leadership and implementation leadership and utilize organizational strategies to create a positive strategic organizational climate for EBP implementation. These should lead to more positive SUD treatment provider attitudes and behaviors that support EBP implementation outcomes of intervention fidelity and implementation process. Consistent with the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) conceptual framework, LOCI creates change at multiple levels within a provider organization (e.g., executives/mid- managers, workgroup leader, service provider) to foster a context supportive of EBP implementation and sustainment. Initial support for the feasibility, acceptability, and utility of the LOCI intervention have been successfully demonstrated in an NIH supported pilot study (R21MH082731, PI: Aarons). The proposed study will test whether LOCI can achieve change in outcomes of general and implementation leadership, implementation climate, implementation process, and EBP fidelity in SUD treatment agencies. Seventy-two workgroup leaders and their providers (i.e., subordinates) will be randomized to either the LOCI condition or a webinar control condition. All direct SUD treatment providers in both conditions will receive training in Motivational Interviewing (MI), a leading EBP
for SUD and HIV prevention and treatment. The test of LOCI will occur within four agencies that provide SUD treatment and HIV services at multiple sites across California. The test of the LOCI intervention will include SUD service providers (n=432), workgroup leaders (n=72), and agency executives/mid-managers (n=16). Hypotheses will be tested comparing LOCI and control group outcomes of leadership, implementation climate, psychological safety climate, provider attitudes and behaviors, MI fidelity, and implementation process. We will also use mixed methods to explore cultural relevance, relative contribution of LOCI components, and differences between in-person and video training. The proposed study will provide a practical implementation strategy that can be utilized to improve workgroup leadership and strategic climate for EBP implementation.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will test the effects of the Leadership and Organizational Change for Implementation (LOCI) intervention in facilitating evidence-based practice (EBP) implementation in substance use disorder (SUD) and HIV services settings. LOCI improves implementation leadership and organizational support to develop strategic climate for EBP implementation. Greater efficiency and effectiveness of EBP implementation will improve the public health impact of evidence-based health and allied healthcare innovations and lead to greater effectiveness of SUD and HIV services.","addiction; Address; Adopted; Adoption; Affordable Care Act; AIDS prevention; Attitude; authority; Behavior; Businesses; California; career preparation; Client satisfaction; Climate; Clinical; Communities; Complex; Control Groups; design; Development; disorder prevention; Drug abuse; Educational Curriculum; Effectiveness; Ensure; evidence base; Evidence based practice; Fostering; Goals; Health; Health Personnel; Health Services; Healthcare; HIV; implementation science; improved; infancy; innovation; Institutes; Intervention; Knowledge; Lead; Leadership; leadership development; Measures; Mediating; Methods; Modeling; motivational enhancement therapy; National Institute of Drug Abuse; Organizational Change; organizational climate; Outcome; Persons; Pilot Projects; Preparation; prevent; Process; programs; Provider; psychologic; Psychology; Public Health; public health relevance; Public Sector; Quality of life; Randomized; randomized trial; Research; research based treatment; Safety; Science; Services; Site; skills; sound; Staff Attitudes; Strategic Planning; Structure; substance abuse treatment; Substance Use Disorder; Testing; theories; Training; Translating; treatment program; United States National Institutes of Health; webinar; Work"
"1R03DA041899-01A1","ASSOCIATIONS OF YOUTH E-CIG AND TOBACCO USE:  ECOLOGICAL MOMENTARY ASSESSMENT","ABADI, MELISSA H","ABADI, MELISSA H","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
National surveys show that among U.S. adolescents, e-cigarettes are the most commonly used nicotine or tobacco product.
Research also shows that adolescent e-cigarette users’ are susceptible to transitioning to combustible tobacco use or dual
use (use of e-cigarettes and combustible tobacco), increasing their risk for nicotine dependence. It critical that we better
understand the risk factors and health effects associated with e-cigarette use, including the transition to combustible
tobacco products and the differential risk for e-cigarette only users and dual users, in order to inform FDA regulations.
Research suggests that socio-ecological factors, such as e-cigarette access, perceptions, marketing, and use by others, may
lead to a greater susceptibility to future willingness and use of combustible tobacco products. However, extant research is
insufficient due to the use of retrospective measures, largely cross-sectional methods, and the focus on between-persons
designs. The proposed study will be one of the first to use a longitudinal ecological momentary assessment (EMA)
approach and baseline CASI survey to examine both within-person and between-persons associations of e-cigarette and
tobacco use, intentions, and willingness, and the role of environment and situational factors on adolescents’ use of e-
cigarettes and tobacco. Data will be collected from 50 adolescents (ages 13-17), who are e-cigarette only users or dual
users of e-cigarettes and tobacco, and living in Kentucky, a state where e-cigarette use rates are three times higher than the
national average for middle schoolers and two times higher than the national average for high schoolers. Using a
framework based in the Social Ecological and Prototype Willingness Models, the specific aims for the proposed study are:
(1) to investigate within-person associations among e-cigarette and tobacco access, motivations, exposure, context,
intentions, willingness, and behaviors; (2) to investigate between-person associations among e-cigarette and tobacco
beliefs, norms, access, motivations, exposure, context, intentions, willingness, and behaviors; and (3) to explore
differences between e-cigarette only users and dual users on e-cigarette and tobacco beliefs, access, motivations, exposure,
context, intentions, willingness, and behaviors as well as differences among the two groups on personal risk factors. The
results of this study will provide strong preliminary data, including estimates of effect sizes, to guide the design of the
larger, more rigorous R01 study to address significant shortcomings in the literature and inform FDA’s Center for
Tobacco Products (CTP) research priorities: (#4) e-cigarette initiation, use, and perceptions, and transitions to tobacco
products and multiple use, (#6) the impact of tobacco product characteristics, (e.g., flavors, labeling and marketing) on
initiation and use, and (#9) perceptions of tobacco products including the impact of labeling and marketing. In line with
the goals of RFA OD 15 004, this study builds on successful collaboration of a promising New Investigator with
experienced scientists in tobacco and e-cigarette research for preparation of an R01 that will launch an independent career
in tobacco research.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Youth e-cigarette use is a major public health concern due to the rapid increase of initiation and use, and the concurrent
lack of established regulation and understanding about its effects, including that e-cigarette use may influence subsequent

"5R01AG046441-04","AGE RELATED CHANGE IN MITOCHONDRIAL ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM AND MITOCHONDRIAL DECLINE","ABADIR, PETER M.","ABADIR, PETER M.","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aging and decline in mitochondrial function are closely linked. Key signs of mitochondrial dysfunction include increased generation of reactive oxygen species, fewer ATP molecules produced per O2 consumed, and increased apoptosis. The reduction in ATP translates to lower energy for cellular maintenance processes including mitobiogenesis and turnover. We recently reported the identification of a functional Mitochondrial Angiotensin System (MAS), and found that aging impacts the ratio of key angiotensin type 1 and type 2 receptors in mitochondria (AT1R and AT2R), that AT1R blocking agents may partially reverse these changes and improve mitochondrial function. Importantly, AT1R-/- mice have an enhanced life span by 25%, in part through an increase in mitochondrial numbers. The effects of aging on the expression of mitochondrial (mt) AT1R and mtAT2R and their contribution to age-related changes in mitochondrial dysfunction have not been previously studied. New preliminary evidence suggests that AT1R blockade in old mice may restore the age- related decline in mitochondrial energy production and improve mitophagy efficiency via alterations in p53- inducible protein (MIEAP) expression. We hypothesize that an age-related increase in mtAT1R/AT2R ratio mediates declines in mitochondrial energy metabolism via increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and impaired elimination of damaged mitochondria. In order to test this hypothesis we propose a comprehensive study of mtAT1R and mtAT2R, in control and losartan (AT1R blocker) treated, young and aged (38-month old) C57BL/6, AT1-/- and AT2-/- mice. Will use age related cardiac muscle bioenergetics failure as a model to study the impact of changes in mtAT1R and mtAT2R following proposed specific aims: 1. To identify age-related changes in peripheral angiotensin system (PAS) and MAS and their contribution to altered reactive nitrogen/oxygen species ROS/RNS generation, using Q-PCR, western blot, confocal and electron microscopy. Generation of ROS/RNS will be quantified in isolated cardiomyocytes and mitochondria from all our animal groups using specific fluorescent probes. 2. To specify the contribution of age-related changes in PAS and MAS to bioenergetic dysfunction by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging in the cardiac tissue of living animals at baseline and after four weeks of placebo or losartan treatment. MAS contributions to the changes in bioenergetics will studied in isolated cardiac mitochondria from all animal groups. 3. To investigate the role of the PAS and MAS on mitochondrial biogenesis, repair, and elimination by utilizing a cardiac cell line (H9C2) instrumented with a P53 activity reporter to measure the effects of over-expressing AT1R and/or AT2R on MIEAP, oxidative stress, mtDNA damage and mitophagy. Similar outcomes will also be compared between control and LOS treated, young and aged (38-month old) C57BL/6, AT1-/- and AT2-/- mice.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is designed to evaluate specific factors in mitochondria that may play a role in late life weakness and increased vulnerability to disease states. Angiotensin receptors 1 and 2 (AT1R and AT2R) are found on the surface and on the inside the mitochondria of virtually all human cells. This study will evaluate how the relationship among these mitochondrial receptors in cardiac cells change with aging, and how these changes might trigger mitochondrial dysfunction, declines in energy production, and cellular decline in older organisms.","Affect; Age; age effect; age related; aged; Aging; AGTR2 gene; Anabolism; Angiotensin Receptor; Angiotensins; Animals; Apoptosis; base; Bioenergetics; Biogenesis; Cardiac; Cardiac Myocytes; Cell Line; Cell membrane; Cells; Confocal Microscopy; Coupled; design; Development; Disease; Elderly; Electron Microscopy; Energy Metabolism; Equilibrium; Event; Failure; Fluorescent Probes; Foundations; Functional disorder; Future; Generations; Human; Image; Impairment; improved; In Situ; in vivo; inhibitor/antagonist; instrument; Intervention; Investigation; Knowledge; Link; Longevity; Losartan; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Maintenance; Measures; Mediating; Mitochondria; Mitochondrial DNA; mitochondrial dysfunction; Modeling; mouse model; Mus; Myocardium; Nitric Oxide; Nitrogen; Organism; Outcome; Oxidative Stress; Oxygen; Pathway interactions; Peripheral; Placebos; Play; Process; Production; Proteins; public health relevance; Reactive Oxygen Species; receptor; receptor expression; Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 1; repaired; Reporter; Reporting; Role; Surface; System; Testing; theories; Tissues; To specify; TP53 gene; Translating; Type 2 Angiotensin II Receptor; virtual; Western Blotting"

for a limited period of time resulting in conformational changes, recruitment or dissociation of
other proteins to/from the complex, and activation or inhibition of the downstream pathways.
Synthetic peptide modulators of protein-peptide interactions are frequently promising
therapeutic candidates in cancer, inflammation and endocrine disorders.
Despite the critical importance of transient protein-peptide interactions for biomedical research
and therapeutic discovery, only a small fraction of these complexes are amenable to
experimental structure determination. Therefore, only accurate peptide docking may lead to a
breakthrough in structural understanding of protein-peptide interactions. Yet for peptides longer
than 6-8 amino acids, the overwhelming size and complexity of the conformational search
space, the inevitable inaccuracies in the binding site representation due to induced fit, inefficient
or insufficiently thorough sampling, and accumulation of scoring function errors prohibit the
accurate determination of peptide binding poses and interactions by computational methods.
The present proposal intends to dramatically expand the range of peptide and protein sizes for
which accurate complex geometry prediction can be achieved by global conformational
optimization. This advance will be made by pursuing two Specific Aims: (Aim 1) Development
and optimization of a reliable peptide cross-docking procedure using chemical field-enhanced
binding site representations and improved entropy calculations in the stochastic global
conformational search in internal coordinates; and (Aim 2) Extension of the developed protocol
to specific biological projects with experimental validation of the predicted geometries and
peptide variants. The innovative strategies proposed in Aim 1 include using a new force field,
the enrichment of binding site representations with chemical fields, and the optimal
conformational expansion of the pocket for induced fit. The targets of Aim 2 include complexes
of Class A and B GPCRs with their protein and peptide modulators and G-protein ai interactions
with GEF peptides.
The attainment of the aims of this proposal will lead to breakthrough advances in flexible
macromolecular docking. It will result in valuable software tools, protocols and shared resources
for the biological community. It will also lead to discovery of new peptide modulators of
important therapeutic, immune, and diagnostic targets.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Interactions between fully flexible peptides and relatively structured surfaces of their molecular partners are of paramount importance in biology, but extremely challenging for experimental structure determination. Until now, computational prediction of these interactions was practically impossible due to the complexity of the search space and the inevitable inaccuracies in representation of molecular partners. The present proposal seeks dramatic expansion of the range of molecular sizes for which accurate complex geometry prediction can be achieved by global conformational optimization.","Achievement; Address; Affinity; Amino Acids; Award; Binding; Binding Sites; Biological; Biological Assay; Biology; Biomedical Research; Chemicals; Communities; Complex; Computer software; Computing Methodologies; design; Development; Diagnostic; Dissociation; Docking; electron density; Encyclopedias; Endocrine System Diseases; Entropy; flexibility; Funding; G-substrate; Geometry; GTP-Binding Proteins; Immune; improved; Inflammation; innovation; Laboratories; Lead; Letters; Licensing; Ligand Binding; Ligands; Malignant Neoplasms; Masks; Mechanics; Mediating; Membrane Proteins; Methods; Molecular; Molecular Conformation; molecular size; Nuclear Receptors; open source; Pathway interactions; Peptides; Performance; Procedures; protein phosphatase inhibitor-2; Proteins; Protocols documentation; public health relevance; Recruitment Activity; Resolution; Resource Sharing; restraint; Sampling; Side; Signal Transduction; Site; Software Tools; Structure; success; Surface; synthetic peptide; System; Therapeutic; therapeutic candidate; Time; Validation; Variant; Vertebral column; web-accessible"
"1F32HL136161-01","NADPH OXIDASE-MEDIATED NLRP3 INFLAMMASOME ACTIVATION IN DAHL SALT-SENSITIVE HYPERTENSION","ABAIS-BATTAD, JUSTINE M","ABAIS-BATTAD, JUSTINE M","Project Summary
Nearly half of the ~70 million Americans with hypertension exhibit salt-sensitivity, with the prevalence
disproportionately greater in African Americans. Our observations in the Dahl Salt-Sensitive (SS) rat model
parallel the same elevation in blood pressure, albuminuria, and infiltration of T lymphocytes and macrophages
into the kidney that is observed in salt-sensitive human hypertension. However, the mechanisms that mediate
the infiltration of immune cells into the kidney and activate adaptive immunity in hypertension are unknown.
The NLRP3 inflammasome is a novel multiprotein complex that plays a critical role in innate immune system
initiation, especially during sterile inflammation, and may be the missing link between innate and adaptive
immune mechanisms in salt-sensitive hypertension. The present studies will test the general hypothesis that
redox activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the SS kidney mediates the initiation of the adaptive immune
response and the subsequent infiltration of T lymphocytes that amplify salt-induced hypertension and renal
damage. To test this hypothesis, two specific aims are proposed. AIM 1 will test the hypothesis that the
expression and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome will increase in Dahl SS rat kidneys during the
transition from a low (LS, 0.4% NaCl) to high salt (HS, 4.0% NaCl) diet, and test whether pharmacological
inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation attenuates salt-induced hypertension and renal damage in Dahl
SS rats. To understand how redox mechanisms contribute to this pathway, AIM 2 will test the hypothesis that
reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediate NLRP3 inflammasome activation in Dahl SS rat kidneys, and test the
contribution of ROS from the renal parenchyma versus infiltrating immune cells to NLRP3 inflammasome
activation through total body irradiation/bone marrow transfer (TBI/BMT) studies. This proposal will be the first
to study the production of ROS in the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes in Dahl SS rats and the first to link
this novel innate immune mechanism to salt-induced initiation of the adaptive immune response, the infiltration
of T lymphocytes into the kidney, leading to the eventual progression of hypertension and renal injury.
Completion of these studies will establish a clear role for the NLRP3 inflammasome and will make new
breakthroughs in defining key factors that initiate the immune system cascade in salt-sensitive hypertension.
These findings will have the potential to make big contributions in the development of new therapeutics.
Through the discovery of more refined targets, earlier intervention strategies and more effective therapies,
these studies have the power to positively impact a large population, with the ultimate goal of one day
overcoming hypertension and related cardiovascular diseases.","Project Narrative
Despite advances in research, hypertension is still a major risk factor leading to other cardiovascular
complications, and given the great health and socioeconomic burden of hypertension especially in African
Americans, there is tremendous importance for better understanding the mechanisms involved in the
progression of this disease. It has long been recognized that inflammation contributes to the development of
hypertension, and the NLRP3 inflammasome is a novel multi-protein complex responsible for the early
detection of danger signals and the initiation of the immune system. This proposal will test the hypothesis that
the NLRP3 inflammasome is involved in the recruitment of immune cells into the kidney, renal damage, and
hypertension caused by excessive salt intake in our Dahl SS rat model of salt-sensitive hypertension.","adaptive immune response; adaptive immunity; African American; Albuminuria; American; Area; Attenuated; Award; Binding; Blood Pressure; Bone Marrow; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cardiovascular system; career; CASP1 gene; Cells; Chronic; cytokine; Dahl Hypertensive Rats; Data; Development; Diet; Disease; Disease Progression; Early Diagnosis; Early Intervention; effective therapy; Exhibits; experience; extracellular; Family; Fellowship; Goals; Health; Human; Hypertension; Immune; Immune system; Immunity; Infiltration; Inflammasome; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Injury; Innate Immune System; Interleukin-1 beta; Interleukin-18; Intervention; Kidney; Link; Lymphocytic Infiltrate; macrophage; marenostrin; Mediating; Mentors; Modeling; Multiprotein Complexes; NADPH Oxidase; Natural Immunity; novel; novel therapeutics; Nucleotides; Oxidation-Reduction; pathogen; Pathway interactions; Pharmacology; Phenotype; Play; Population; pressure; Prevalence; Production; Proteins; Public Health; Reactive Oxygen Species; receptor; Recruitment Activity; Research; Research Personnel; Research Proposals; Risk Factors; Role; salt intake; salt sensitive; salt sensitive hypertension; Signal Transduction; socioeconomics; Sodium Chloride; Sterility; Stimulus; T-Lymphocyte; Testing; Whole-Body Irradiation"
"5R01AI117911-02","C. ELEGANS TO STUDY ORGANISMAL CONTROL OF RECOVERY FROM BACTERIAL INFECTIONS","ABALLAY, ALEJANDRO","ABALLAY, ALEJANDRO","<U+FEFF>   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) This proposal describes experiments designed to understand the mechanisms involved in the control of recovery from bacterial infections. To recover from an infection and return to homeostasis, the host must activate mechanisms capable of controlling the damage caused by pathogen virulence factors, inflammation, and a potentially toxic antibiotic exposure. Failure to properly recover from infections manifests in the
form of recurrent infections, inappropriate wound healing, autoimmune diseases, and chronic inflammatory disorders. The mechanisms involved in pathogen recognition and immune activation have been very well studied, but the cellular and systemic responses involved in recovery after an infection is cleared are not well defined. We have established a Caenorhabditis elegans model of acute infection and antibiotic treatment for studying biological changes during the resolution phase of an infection. We found that genes that are markers of innate immunity are downregulated upon recovery, while genes involved in xenobiotic detoxification, redox regulation, and cellular homeostasis are upregulated. Using gene expression profiling, in silico analysis, and reverse genetic approaches, we have linked to the control of recovery from infection to the function of conserved transcription factors, including th GATA transcription factor ELT-2, the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16, and the Nrf transcription factor SKN-1. The proposed experiments will explore the general hypothesis that neural GPCRs and cell non-autonomous signals from different neurons may act on non-neural tissues to regulate recovery from infection at the organismal level. Given the conserved nature of GPCR-mediated signaling and the conservation of the transcription factors involved in the control of recovery, the proposed studies should lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms used by metazoans to control recovery from bacterial infection at the whole animal level.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Infections by bacterial pathogens generate substantial tissue damage and alteration in metabolism that have detrimental consequences even after infections have been cleared. Failure to reverse the alterations in host physiology that take place in response to infections may result in recurrent infections, inappropriate wound healing, autoimmune diseases, and chronic inflammatory disorders. We plan to dissect mechanisms of control of recovery from infections that operate at the whole animal level. A better understanding of organismal responses that take place after an infection has been cleared could lead to new therapeutic targets for inflammatory diseases.","Ablation; Acute; American Society of Hematology; Animals; Antibiotic Therapy; Antibiotics; Autoimmune Diseases; Bacterial Infections; base; Biological; C. elegans genome; Caenorhabditis elegans; Cells; Chronic; Collaborations; Computer Simulation; design; Disease; Dissection; dopaminergic neuron; Drug Metabolic Detoxication; Endocrine; Exhibits; experimental study; Failure; G Protein-Coupled Receptor Signaling; G-Protein-Coupled Receptors; Gene Expression Profiling; Genes; Genetic; genetic approach; Genetic Transcription; Homeostasis; immune activation; Immune response; Immune system; Immunity; Infection; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Innate Immune Response; insight; Killings; Laboratories; Lead; Ligands; Link; Mediator of activation protein; Metabolism; microbial; Modeling; mutant; Natural Immunity; Nature; Nematoda; Nervous System control; Nervous system structure; neural circuit; Neurons; Neuropeptides; neuroregulation; Neurosecretory Systems; Neurotransmitters; new therapeutic target; optogenetics; Organism; Oxidation-Reduction; pathogen; Pathway interactions; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; Physiological; Physiological Processes; Physiology; promoter; protein folding; Proteins; public health relevance; Publishing; Receptor Cell; receptor function; receptor-mediated signaling; Recovery; Recurrence; Regulation; relating to nervous system; Resolution; response; reverse genetics; Role; Signal Transduction; Signaling Molecule; Surface; Synapses; System; Technology; Testing; Tissues; transcription factor; Universities; Virulence Factors; Wound Healing; Xenobiotics"

In addition, the microfluidic platform we will develop to accomplish this will also enable, for the fist time, the targeted recovery of genome-size DNA fragments out of a heterogeneous sample. Nucleic acid analysis through technologies like microarrays and next-generation sequencing are transforming the way that many biological questions are addressed. The power of these approaches stems from their ability to obtain system-wide information with single molecule detail. However, a major technical barrier that often prevents their effective application is that many biological systems are too complex to be straightforwardly sequenced: Even with bioinformatic algorithms, the billions of short, sequence dreads are often too complex to piece together into useful information. To address this challenge, we will develop a technology that allows nucleic acids to be quantitated and sorted in a heterogeneous sample. Importantly, this method will utilize specific multiplexedTaqMan PCR assays performed in giant-unilamellarvesicles (GUVs); this will make it much more specific and targetable than methods that sort DNA based on size or staining properties. Moreover, by assaying individual molecules or cells in GUVs, we will be able to perform billions of PCR assays in parallel, enabling massive, heterogeneous samples to be screened to identify and recover extremely rare targets. This basic technology will be broadly useful throughout biological research and has immediate human health impacts, including for detecting and sequencing cancer DNA in the blood early in the disease, analyzing genetic heterogeneity in tumor cells, and identifying immune cells latently infected with HIV. The aims are:  <U+FFFD> Specific Aim 1: Demonstrate microfluidic generation and FACS sorting of thermostable femtoliterGiant-Unilamellar Vesicles.

We will explore different PCR reagents to optimize the GUV-PCRs and benchmark the efficiency of  these reactions against ones performed in aqueous-in-oil droplets generated with our own microfluidics  and with the Bio-rad QX100 digital PCR machine. We will measure efficiency using endpoint fluorescence, fraction of positive reactors, and yield of DNA recovered out of the reactors. We will also optimize protocols for rupturing GUVs to access their contents.  <U+FFFD> Specific Aim 3: Demonstrate 1000X greater sensitivity than competing platforms by performing over 1 billion digital GUV-PCRs, and recovery of positive molecules with FACS. We will demonstrate the superiority of GUVs for digital PCR by performing 1000X more reactions than is possible with existing droplet technologies. We will also demonstrate the ability to recover rare DNA molecules by FACS sorting the positive GUVs.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will develop a system for analyzing and sorting DNA for important biological and industrial applications through the development of powerful microfluidic technologies.

Abate Abstract: Accurate single cell genomic sequencing is important for applications ranging from copy number variation analysis in cancer to the investigation of uncultivable microbes. To provide sufficient DNA for sequencing, a single cell's genome must be massively amplified. However, existing methods introduce errors (MALBAC) or result in significant bias (MDA), yielding low-confidence genomes with gaps in coverage. In this proposal, we will develop single cell digital droplet MDA (sc-ddMDA), a method that will combine the uniform amplification of MALBAC with the high copying accuracy of MDA. This project will extend our preliminary results in which we have demonstrated the ability to reliably and uniformly amplify the genomes of just ten bacterial cells. Using novel biochemical and microfluidic methods, we will push the limit to a single cell and will implement automation for high-throughput processing of, ultimately, thousands of single cells. Importantly, we will provide two versions of the technology, one using no specialized equipment accessible to any lab with molecular biology expertise, and a higher-throughput version using microfluidics and robotic automation.

We have been developed a novel experimental paradigm, which combines preclinical analyses in genetically-engineered mouse (GEM) models of castration-resistant prostate cancer with sophisticated cross-species computational analyses to identify master regulators of drug response. We will apply this strategy to study Abiraterone, which is an inhibitor of androgen biosynthesis that has been shown to improve survival of men with advanced prostate cancer. However, although Abiraterone has shown promising results in clinical trials, not all patients respond to Abiraterone
and most of those who do respond initially eventually fail treatment. Therefore, there is a critica need to pursue preclinical investigations to understand the mechanisms of action of Abiraterone in specific tumor contexts, and to define biomarkers predictive of response and resistance.  Toward this end, our studies will focus on the following critical questions: (Aim 1): In which tumor contexts is Abiraterone responsive? We will perform preclinical studies using our GEM models, with the goal of identifying responsive and non-responsive tumors. Using gene expression signatures from these responsive and non-responsive tumors, we will perform cross-species computational analyses to identify master regulators that predict response to Abiraterone. Candidate master regulators will be validated to human prostate cancer, as well as to assess their functional relevance for response to Abiraterone in vivo. The goal of these studies is to elucidate mechanisms of Abiraterone response and biomarkers that predict its efficacy. (Aim 2): Can the efficacy of Abiraterone be improved by co-targeting with anti-androgens? We will perform preclinical studies in GEM models to evaluate the efficacy of Abireratone in combination with the anti-androgen, MDV3100. Using molecular signatures from mice treated with the individual versus combinatorial agents, we will identify master regulators that inform on the mechanisms of the drug interaction and as biomarkers of multi-drug response. Candidate master regulators will be validated to human prostate cancer, as well as in functional studies to asses their efficacy for drug action in vivo. The goal of these studies is to
inform on mechanisms underlying the interaction of Abiraterone and anti-androgens, and to identify biomarkers of multi-drug response. (Aim 3): Why does treatment with Abiraterone fail? Considering mechanisms of intrinsic versus acquired resistance, we will establish GEM models that are resistant to Abiraterone treatment. Using molecular signatures from mice prior to or immediately following Abiraterone treatment or following tumor recurrence, we will identify master regulators of drug resistance. These will be validated to human prostate cancer, and to assess their ability to affect resistance to drug treatment.

Our proposed research is focused on elucidating molecular mechanisms involved in tumor progression, dissemination, and metastasis of prostate cancer using analyses of in vivo mouse models to inform on human prostate cancer. Thus, we have generated genetically-engineered mouse (GEM) models of metastatic prostate cancer. Using lineage-tracing of these models, we have defined a temporal progression from tumorigenesis to metastasis, and have isolated primary tumor, disseminated, and metastatic cells for molecular analyses. In parallel, we have established state-of-the- art systems biology approaches to accurately integrate molecular data from mouse models to human cancer. By using these advanced systems approaches to interrogate our GEM models, we have identified transcriptional regulatory and epigenetic control mechanisms associated with metastasis progression. In particular, we have shown that a transcription factor pair, namely FOXM1 and CENPF, are master regulators of prostate cancer malignancy. We further demonstrate that the ETS transcription factor, ETV4, is required for metastasis. Moreover, we have found that among regulatory pathways that distinguish metastases from primary tumors are those that are associated with epigenetic modifications, such as the histone methyltransferase, SUV39H1. Thus, we have hypothesized that the molecular cascade associated with metastasis progression includes transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, which drive tumor aggressiveness and promote their metastasis, as well as epigenetic regulators, which are associated with formation of metastases. We will investigate these mechanisms as follows: In Aim 1, we will investigate transcriptional mechanisms associated with metastasis progression, focusing on FOXM1-CENPF and ETV4, to delineate their individual functions and potential cross-talk, as well as to elucidate their mechanism(s) of action. In Aim 2, we will investigate epigenetic regulatory mechanisms that promote metastasis, focusing on histone modifications and particularly the histone-modifying enzyme SUV39H1, to delineate its functions and mechanism(s) of action. In Aim 3, we will pursue discovery-based systems analyses to investigate key molecular aspects of metastasis progression, in particular, to identify mechanisms associated with organ specificity of metastases and molecular mechanisms associated with clonal relationship of tumors and metastases.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Metastasis is the primary cause of prostate cancer mortality; however, despite the pressing clinical need, there are many unresolved issues regarding the underlying biological and molecular mechanisms. Our proposed analyses using in vivo mouse models and systems approaches will elucidate transcriptional and epigenetic control mechanisms that provide coordinated control of metastatic progression. These analyses utilize novel approaches to study fundamental aspects of dissemination and metastasis and will ultimately lead to the identification of new targets for therapeutic intervention as well as new biomarkers for early detection of metastasis.","advanced system; Alleles; base; Biochemical; Biological; Biological Models; Cancer Etiology; Cell Culture Techniques; Cells; CENPF gene; Cessation of life; ChIP-seq; Clinical; Data; Diagnosis; early detection biomarkers; Enzymes; Epigenetic Process; Epithelial; ETV4 gene; FOXM1 gene; gain of function; Gene Targeting; Generations; Genetic Transcription; Genetically Engineered Mouse; histone methyltransferase; histone modification; Histones; Human; in vivo; Individual; Investigation; Lead; loss of function; Malignant neoplasm of prostate; Malignant Neoplasms; men; Mesenchymal; Metastatic Prostate Cancer; Methylation; Modeling; Modification; Molecular; Molecular Analysis; Molecular Profiling; mortality; mouse model; Mus; Neoplasm Metastasis; new therapeutic target; novel strategies; Organ; Organ Specificity; Primary Neoplasm; programs; Prostate; public health relevance; Regulation; Regulatory Pathway; Research; Role; Site; Systems Analysis; Systems Biology; Therapeutic Intervention; Tissue-Specific Gene Expression; transcription factor; tumor; tumor progression; tumorigenesis; Xenograft Model"

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) affects approximately 20,000 patients each year in the United States alone, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Yet, despite its significance, it has been relatively neglecte in basic cancer research, and as a consequence, many salient issues regarding its molecular and cellular origins have not been fully elucidated. In particular, the cell(s) of origin of bladde cancer and consequences of specific oncogene/tumor suppressor alterations in these cells of origin have not been systematically investigated. To a large extent, this reflects the limitations f current model systems for pursuing such studies. In the current proposal, we describe innovative genetically-engineered mouse models for investigating the cell type(s) of origin of bladder cancer. In particular, we have established an approach to achieve inducible gene targeting in specific cell types in the bladder urothelium, which will enable our studies of the cel of origin in vivo as well as their isolation for tumor engraftment assays and explant approaches. In addition, we have established novel culture methods to derive patient-derived organoids to model human bladder cancer in explant culture, which will provide a vital resource for extrapolating our findings from mouse to man using integrative systems biology approaches. Thus, we are ideally poised to investigate the hypothesis that the cell type of origin for bladder cancer, combined with specific oncogene/tumor suppressor alterations, can generate tumor subtypes that are associated with distinct treatment responses and/or patient outcomes. Toward this end, we will pursue the following Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will systematically analyze the tumorigenic potential of urothelial cell types in GEM models in vivo, and will perform cross-species systems analyses of these findings compared with patient-derived human organoids. In Aim 2, we will investigate whether tumorigenic properties of potential cell type(s) of origin are defined by specific oncogene/tumor suppressor alterations. In particular, we will evaluate the oncogenic activities of ERBB2 (HER2/Neu) and the tumor suppressor activity of TSC1, both of which are altered in MIBC, in order to investigate their functional relevance in orthotopic models and ultimately in GEM models. In Aim 3, we will perform preclinical studies to determine whether distinct cell types of origin help define treatment response, by focusing on chemotherapy agents that are widely used in the clinic, as well as on agents that target PI3 kinase, which is highly relevant for bladder cancer. Thus, the studies outlined in this proposal will provide a comprehensive analysis of the cell types of origin of bladder cancer, their roles in
defining bladder cancer subtypes, and their relevance for treatment response.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A characteristic feature of most human cancers is its inherent heterogeneity. Understanding cancer subtypes is important for predicting patient outcome, as well as for personalizing treatments for individual patients.

Numerous clinical trials of targeted pharmacological agents are now in process for fragile X syndrome (FXS) and Down syndrome (DS). Condition-specific behavioral treatments also are emerging. Evaluation of all such treatments is being hampered by a lack of adequate cognitive and behavioral endpoints. In this project, we propose to evaluate the adequacy of expressive language sampling for deriving language-relevant clinical endpoints. In this procedure, expressive language samples are collected in highly structured and scripted, yet naturalistic, interactions. These samples can then
be analyzed to derive clinical endpoints reflecting important dimensions of language skill and atypical language behavior. Although the suitability of expressive language sampling for clinical trials with FXS or DS (or ID more generally) has yet to be determined, the procedures are especially promising because they yield clinically relevant and functional endpoints, have been shown to capture impairments that are common to ID as well as those specific to FXS or DS, and have been shown to yield robust indicators of developmental change within typical and other language-impaired populations. In this project, we propose: (1) to examine the basic psychometric properties of measures derived from expressive language sampling techniques, including establishing their test-retest reliability, internal consistency, validity, and sensitiviy; (2) to evaluate differences in the psychometric properties of expressive language sampling techniques as a function of variations in participant etiology, age, gender, autism symptom severity, and level of ID; (3) to compare the psychometric properties of three different expressive language sampling techniques; and (4) to evaluate the feasibility of implementing the expressive language sampling across multiple sites, as would be required in a typical clinical trial. These aims will be addressed by collecting expressive language samples from children, adolescents, and young adults with FXS or DS. Samples will be collected within three interaction formats: conversation, narration, and the structured interactions comprising the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS). Measures derived from the samples will include those indexing syntax (an area of especially severe impairment in DS) and perseveration (an area of especially severe impairment for FXS). Test-retest reliability will be assessed at 4 weeks (+/- 1 week) using alternate versions of sampling materials. Internal consistency will be assessed by computing alpha coefficients within and across sampling techniques. Standardized tests and informant report will be used as indicators of validity. A two-year longitudinal follow-up will yield an estimate of sensitivity to change. Participants will be tested at multiple sites, each with considerable experience in the evaluation of individuals with FXS or DS.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Gatlinburg Conference on Research in ID/DD is an annual scientific meeting designed to advance translational biobehavioral research on intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). The meeting provides a forum for investigators at all career stages to present and discuss cutting-edge biobehavioral research and theory. The conference focuses on the causes, consequences, and treatments for specific disorders, as well as on the processes underlying IDD more generally. Each year's conference has a scientific theme that is explored through plenary lectures, but the theme does not constrain the symposia or poster sessions, which span a broad range of topics, from basic to translational and applied science. The themes are designed to expose participants to theoretical frameworks, methods, and findings from other disciplines and fields of study, including from basic and translational neuroscience, as well as fields focused on cultural influences on development and IDD. Thus, the specific aims of the Gatlinburg Conference are: (1) Promote the exchange of scientific findings, theoretical perspectives, and methodological innovations and thereby accelerate, and encourage innovation in, translational research on IDD. (2) Facilitate collaborative interdisciplinary research on IDD. (3) Ensure that biobehavioral scientists are exposed to relevant translational and basic science findings, methods, and perspectives from neurobiology and medicine, thereby enriching their research and further supporting interdisciplinarity. (4) Serve as an interdisciplinary training and career development resource for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and early career faculty. (5) Increase the diversity of IDD research by supporting the development of early career scientists from under-represented groups. Although these aims are largely unchanged from the previously funded application, we propose several innovations in the conference in present application to ensure increased success in achieving those aims.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The field of IDD is increasingly interdisciplinary, biobehavioral, and translational. The Gatlinburg Conference on Research and Theory in Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities provides a unique venue at which the latest biobehavioral research findings, methods, and theoretical frameworks are presented and discussed; new interdisciplinary collaborations relevant to IDD are initiated; the careers of a diverse pool of researchers interested in IDD are launched and supported; and relevant constructs and findings from basic science disciplines are highlighted. Ultimately, the conference shapes the biobehavioral scientific agenda of the IDD field and accelerates efforts to translate research results into innovative programs of treatment and prevention that will improve the lives of people with IDD and their families.","Address; American; American Psychological Association; Applied Research; Attention; Award; Basic Science; Behavioral; Behavioral Sciences; biobehavior; California; career; career development; Child Development; Collaborations; Communities; cost; design; Development; disability; Discipline; Disease; Doctor of Philosophy; Down Syndrome; early-career faculty; Empirical Research; Ensure; Extramural Activities; Family; field study; Fostering; Fragile X Syndrome; Funding; graduate student; Grant; improved; improved outcome; Individual; Injectable; innovation; insight; Intellectual functioning disability; interdisciplinary collaboration; Interdisciplinary Study; interest; International; lectures; Location; Medicine; meetings; Mentors; Methodology; Methods; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; Neurobiology; next generation; Oral; Participant; Policies; Postdoctoral Fellow; posters; Prediabetes syndrome; Prevention; Prevention program; Process; programs; public health relevance; Research; Research Personnel; Research Support; Resource Development; Resource Sharing; Science; Scientist; Senior Scientist; Services; Shapes; Site; skills; Societies; Students; success; symposium; theories; Therapeutic; Time; Training; Translating; translational neuroscience; Translational Research; Travel; treatment program; Universities; Unmarried person; Voting; Work"

 Radical cystectomy is the cornerstone of treatment for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer
and is among the most complicated oncologic procedures performed in the United States. Along with
neoadjuvant chemotherapy, these two modalities comprise the current standard of care for the disease.
Approximately 1/3 of patients who undergo radical cystectomy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy will have no
residual disease left in the bladder. Retrospective literature supports the use of cystectomy deferral in patients
who undergo endoscopic biopsy showing no residual disease. However, this algorithm is prone to a high false
negative rate necessitating salvage cystectomy, delay of which may result in worse survival outcomes.
 The first aim of the proposal will explore the phenomenon of mutation clearance and persistence in
urine-derived cell-free DNA as a marker for disease absence or persistence, respectively, after endoscopic
resection and chemotherapy. In preliminary studies, combination of single molecule tags and next generation
sequencing resulted in high sensitivity detection of somatic variants previously identified in tumor whole
exomes in prechemotherapy urine samples. At least one variant persisted in postchemotherapy urine samples
from two of two nonresponders, and no variants were detected in urine samples from two of two complete
responders. This preliminary data shows that the assay is feasible, reliable, and merits further exploration.
The assay will be used on banked samples collected on a previously completed trial (NCT01031420) and on
samples from a prospective clinical trial opening now at Fox Chase Cancer Center.
 Localized bladder cancer demonstrates a relatively high rate of pathological complete chemoresponse,
but the mechanism of chemosensitivity remains incompletely understood. Data described herein suggests that
the immune infiltrate is driven by CD8+ cells and high neoantigen density. Neoantigens are the non-self
peptides that result from somatic missense or frameshift mutations that can be recognized by the immune
system. Aim 2 of the proposal seeks to clinch a role for the immune system in this context by identifying
tumor-specific cytotoxic T-cells which recognize tumor neoantigens. Expressed neoantigens will be identified
using whole exome sequencing and RNA-seq of tumors and available computational algorithms. These
mutant peptides will then be synthesized and used to screen live patient-derived CD8+ cells for neoantigen-
specific cytotoxic responses. Samples to be used in this study will be obtained from a prospective clinical trial
opening now at Fox Chase Cancer Center. This hypothesis-driven molecular and cellular biological study can
potentially identify a new and unexpected mechanism for chemoresponse mediated by the immune system.
 If successful, these aims will go hand-in-hand in the future to prospectively and retrospectively identify
responders and provide a framework to manipulate the immune system to achieve chemoresponse with the
long term goal of safe radical cystectomy avoidance.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
 This proposal seeks to create a method of identifying pathologic complete responders to chemotherapy
in bladder cancer patients in order to spare patients from a complicated, expensive, and life altering cancer
surgery (radical cystectomy). If successful, this technology will allow patients to safely avoid the surgery and
may be applied to other diseases where pre-surgical chemotherapy is used to the effect of complete response.
Because radical cystectomy is an expensive surgery with frequent complications and readmissions, a cost
savings is also likely to be achieved by avoiding surgery.","Aftercare; Algorithms; base; Biological; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; biomarker-driven; Biopsy; Bladder; Bladder Neoplasm; Body Fluids; Cancer Patient; cancer surgery; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; cell free DNA; Cells; chemotherapy; Cisplatin; Clinic; Clinical Trials; cohort; Computational algorithm; Consult; Cost Savings; Cystectomy; cytotoxic; Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes; Data; density; design; Detection; Development; Disease; Disease Marker; DNA; Endoscopic Biopsy; Enrollment; Excision; exome; exome sequencing; Fox Chase Cancer Center; Frameshift Mutation; Future; Genes; Goals; Immune; Immune system; Immunotherapy; In complete remission; interest; Left; Life; Literature; Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder; Measures; Mediating; method development; Methods; Missense Mutation; Modality; Molecular; Muscle; mutant; Mutation; Neoadjuvant Therapy; neoplastic cell; next generation sequencing; novel; Operative Surgical Procedures; Pathologic; Patients; Peptides; Peripheral; Population; Procedures; prospective; Radical Cystectomy; receptor; Receptor Cell; Residual state; Residual Tumors; response; Role; Sampling; screening; single molecule; Somatic Mutation; Source; standard of care; survival outcome; Technology; Testing; transcriptome sequencing; Transurethral Resection; tumor; Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes; United States; urinary; Urine; Urologic Oncology; Variant"

one of psychiatry's most invasive treatments and remains limited to academic medical centers or larger, metropolitan 
hospitals. Despite ECT's 80-year history, the lack of understanding regarding the neurobiology and 
the mechanism of action of ECT response limit the development of safer, more accessible treatments. The 
overall aim of this investigation is to identify the biomarkers of ECT response. A case-control longitudinal design 
and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will simultaneously assess between (Aim 
1) and within network changes (Aim 2) associated with ECT response. Our preliminary data supports our hypothesis 
that ECT response increases between network relationships amid frontal and default mode networks 
and reduces within network low frequency power (0.01 to 0.1 hertz (Hz)) in the subcallosal cingulate gyrus. 
The ECT series is associated with increased seizure threshold and reduced seizure duration. These 
anticonvulsant properties of ECT may be related to the reduction in spectral power within functional networks. 
In Aim 3, proton spectroscopy (H-MRS) will measure changes in concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid 
(GABA), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter, associated with ECT response. The multi-modal aspect of this

(Aims 1 and 2). Specifically, we hypothesize that increased GABA concentrations in the posterior cingulate will 
correlate with reduced low frequency spectral power (0.01 and 0.1 Hz) within limbic and para-limbic networks.

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remains the gold-standard treatment for patients with depressive episodes.
During a typical four-week ECT series, most depressive episodes remit, and formerly suicidal or psychotically
depressed patients will resume their premorbid levels of functioning. Independent of the antidepressant effect
of ECT, many patients experience debilitating but transient cognitive effects such as attention and memory def-
icits. These unwanted side effects are particularly troubling for older patients who are more likely to have exist-
ing cognitive deficits. Both the stimulus delivery (electrode placement, pulse amplitude, and pulse width) and
seizure induction appear to work in synergy, but the underlying mechanism of action for successful response
has yet to be fully elucidated. Moreover, further work is needed to understand the relationship between clinical
improvement and cognitive impairment. This investigation will examine the clinical and neurocognitive impact
of targeted medial temporal lobe engagement as a function of pulse amplitude, one of several variable factors
influencing the ECT charge. The ECT charge is measured in millicoulombs (mC) and derived from multiplying
pulse train duration, pulse-pair frequency, pulse width, and pulse amplitude. Pulse amplitude determines the
induced electric field strength in the brain and is presently fixed at 900 milliamperes (mA) with no clinical or
scientific justification. The central hypothesis of this investigation is that the optimal pulse amplitude for an indi-
vidual patient will enhance neuroplasticity (clinical response) while minimizing the disruption of dominant hemi-
sphere hippocampal cognitive circuitry (resulting in cognitive stability). Our preliminary data informs the dosage
range between 600 and 800 mA. Pulse amplitudes outside of this range compromise efficacy (500 mA) or may
increase risk of cognitive impairment (900 mA). The first aim of this investigation will identify the electric field
strength and neuroplasticity associated with clinical response. Critically, this aim will establish the neuroplas-
ticity threshold, which is defined as the electric field strength necessary to induce neuroplasticity. The second
aim will detect the neural correlates of ECT-mediated cognitive changes, which may be related to disrupted
dominant hemisphere long-term potentiation. The third aim will use data-driven dual regression to predict the
optimal pulse amplitude for an individual patient. This contribution will be significant because the electric field,
when manipulated by pulse amplitude, can subsequently maximize hippocampal neuroplasticity (efficacy) and
minimize disrupted connectivity (cognitive stability) thus improving clinical outcomes.

amplitude (electric field strength) and targeted engagment of the medial temporal lobes is
unknown. This investigation will identify the relationship and intermediate steps between pulse
amplitude and clinical outcomes and develop a model to select the optimal pulse amplitude dose for an

Ubiquitination, innate immunity and inflammatory bowel disease are tightly linked. Dysregulation of ubiquitination
pathways causes dysfunction of innate immune signaling which in turn, affects the mucosal immunity of the
gastrointestinal tract. In the previous granting cycle, our lab has made important contributions in helping
understand this process of dysregulation. Given this, in the next granting period, we will focus on an E3 ligase
newly discovered to regulate the NOD:RIP2 signaling pathway. xIAP is a RING-domain containing E3 ubiquitin
ligase. Its role in pediatric Crohn's disease was discovered when whole exome sequencing was performed on
pediatric patients with severe, steroid-resistant IBD. A significant subset of these patients were found to have
both truncating and missense xIAP mutations, and early work showed that patients with mutations in the BIR2
domain of xIAP had deficient NOD:RIP2 signaling. While this work is incredibly important, the published literature
is incomplete and contains many inconsistencies. For instance, Crohn's disease-causing xIAP mutations are
present throughout the gene and only the mutations in a small region of xIAP (the BIR2 domain) affect NOD:RIP2
signaling. Additionally, while NOD2 polymorphic patients are at an increased risk of developing Crohn's disease,
the high level of NOD2 polymorphism in the population (approximately 9%) means that most Crohn's disease-
associated NOD2 carriers have normal GI mucosal immunologic homeostasis. In contrast, xIAP mutation-
carriers develop a severe form of inflammatory bowel disease before the age of 5 years old that is intractable to
current treatments. Lastly, while NOD2 polymorphisms phenotypes are largely restricted to Crohn's disease,
xIAP mutation carriers also develop X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome, a serious life-threatening
inflammatory response to cytomegalovirus exposure. For all these reasons, we hypothesize that defective
NOD:RIP2 signaling is not the only pathway affected by xIAP mutation and by understanding the
pathways affected, we can discover new targets for inflammatory bowel disease treatment. It will be
important to characterize genotype:phenotype relationships of xIAP mutation carriers. It will be important to
determine the ubiquitination patterns disrupted by xIAP mutations in innate immune and inflammatory signaling,
and it will be crucial to determine if inhibition of WT xIAP will be efficacious in the treatment of inflammatory
bowel disease.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Diseases such as Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis occur in the setting of a dysregulated response to the
bacteria that line the intestine. One of the key proteins designed to maintain a normal environment is called xIAP
(x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis). In a proportion of inflammatory bowel disease patients, this protein is non-
functional and causes severe intestinal inflammation that is difficult to treat. This grant application aims to
determine how mutant forms of xIAP cause inflammatory abnormalities and to then use that knowledge to
determine if xIAP-based treatment of disease is a viable option for these patients.","5 year old; Affect; Apoptosis; Apoptosis Inhibitor; Applications Grants; Bacteria; base; Biological Markers; Biological Models; Cell Death; Cells; Childhood; Clinical; CRISPR/Cas technology; Crohn's disease; cytokine; Cytomegalovirus; Data; Dendritic Cells; density; Development; Disease; Environment; Epithelial Cells; exome sequencing; feeding; Functional disorder; Funding; gain of function; Gastrointestinal tract structure; Gene Expression; gene replacement; Generations; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Polymorphism; Genotype; Grant; Homeostasis; Immune; Immune signaling; Immunologics; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Inflammatory disease of the intestine; Inflammatory Response; inhibitor/antagonist; Interleukin-1; Intestines; Knowledge; Life; Link; Literature; Liver diseases; macrophage; Mass Spectrum Analysis; mouse model; Mucosal Immunity; Mus; mutant; Mutation; mutation carrier; Natural Immunity; NF-kappa B; nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; novel; Pathway interactions; patient subsets; Patients; Pattern; pediatric patients; Pharmacology; Phenotype; Phosphotransferases; Physiological; Planets; Population; preclinical trial; Process; Protein Engineering; Proteins; Proteomics; Publishing; response; RIPK2 gene; Risk; Role; Scaffolding Protein; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Site; Steroid Resistance; Stimulus; success; T-Lymphocyte; TLR1 gene; Ubiquitin; ubiquitin-protein ligase; Ubiquitination; Ulcerative Colitis; Work; X-Linked lymphoproliferative disorders"
"5R01GM086550-09","INNATE IMMUNE SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION SPECIFICITY IN INFLAMMATORY DISEASE","ABBOTT, DEREK W.","ABBOTT, DEREK W.","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aberrant NOD2 signaling causes granulomatous inflammatory disease. Patients with loss-of-function NOD2 alleles are prone to the development of Crohn's disease, an inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. In contrast, patients with gain-of-function NOD2 mutations develop Early Onset Sarcoidosis (EOS), an inflammatory disorder characterized by noncaseating granulomas that cause lung, liver and eye damage. The fact that both loss-of-function polymorphisms and gain-of-function mutations both cause inflammatory diseases is likely due to the fact that NOD2 functions as a rheostat to help maintain normal immunologic homeostasis. This rheostat function begins upon bacterial invasion of the cell whereupon NOD2 binds to a breakdown product of bacterial peptidoglycan. This activates NOD2 such that it can modulate the innate immune system to help tailor the adaptive immune response to eradicate the offending pathogen. Either too much or too little NOD2 activation can be deleterious, and this imbalance is central to the development of inflammatory disease. NOD2 and its obligate kinase RIP2 are part of a positive regulatory circuit in which intracellular bacterial recognition causes the NOD2:RIP2 complex to be activated. In addition to stimulating autophagy, bacteriocidal activity, MHC Class II presentation and MAPK activation, the NOD2:RIP2 complex activates NF-<U+03BA>B. Both NOD2 and RIP2 are NF-<U+03BA>B regulated genes, and as such, their activation causes a positive feedback loop in which activation of NOD2:RIP2 stimulates further activation and further inflammation. Additionally, NOD2 and RIP2 expression are stimulated by a variety of mediators of inflammation, including TNF and IFN. Given this, in the prior granting period, we hypothesized that inhibiting this positive regulatory circuit might be efficacious in treating inflammatory disease. We were successful in identifying nanomolar inhibitors of RIP2's kinase activity. Despite this, a troubling
fact remains: We still don't know what the kinase activity of RIP2 is doing in the cell. Some studies have shown that the kinase activity is dispensable for NOD2 activity while others have shown that it's essential. Our work has helped clarify this as we showed that RIP2 was misclassified as a serine-threonine kinase. It is actually a dual specificity kinase, meaning that t phosphorylates serines, threonines and tyrosines. Our own work has shown that inhibition of RIP2 attenuates the acute NOD2 inflammatory response. While my lab has found that RIP2's kinase activity helps regulate NF-<U+03BA>B, we don't know its role in regulating other NOD2-driven responses like autophagy or MAPK signaling. The uncertainty regarding RIP2's kinase activity takes on added importance given the interest of pharmaceutical companies in inhibiting RIP2 in inflammatory diseases like sarcoidosis, asthma, IBD and inflammatory arthritis. Understanding the kinase activity is essential if the goal is to inhibit RIP2 in inflammatory disease and to then determine efficacy and response in those diseases. This knowledge is also essential to predict outcomes of RIP2 inhibition in inflammatory disease. This grant application aims to answer these key questions.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Faulty NOD2 activity is responsible for exacerbating inflammatory diseases. Diseases such as asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, sarcoidosis and arthritis can all be worsened by too much NOD2 activity. RIP2 is an obligate kinase in the NOD2 signaling pathway. In our prior granting period, we found FDA-approved drugs that could inhibit RIP2. This has attracted the interest of pharmaceutical companies as a number are now screening for new RIP2 inhibitors. Despite this, our knowledge of RIP2's role in the cell is murky.
This grant application aims to identify RIP2 substrates, to identify biomarkers that can identify NOD2-driven inflammatory disease and predict which patient best will responds to RIP2 inhibitors, to identify additional pharmaceuticals to fine-tune the inhibition of this pathway and o determine efficacy of RIP2 inhibition in inflammatory disease.","Acute; adaptive immune response; Alleles; Applications Grants; Arthritis; Asthma; Attention; Attenuated; Autophagocytosis; Binding; Biological Markers; Biotechnology; Cells; chemical genetics; Chemicals; Cladribine; Complex; Confusion; Crohn's disease; cytokine; Data; Development; Disease; Disease model; early onset; Erlotinib; Event; Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis; Eye; FDA approved; Feedback; feeding; Funding; gain of function; gain of function mutation; Gastrointestinal Diseases; Gastrointestinal tract structure; Gefitinib; Genes; Genetic; genetic approach; Genetic Polymorphism; Goals; Grant; Granuloma; Granulomatous; Homeostasis; Immune signaling; Immunologics; Inflammation; Inflammation Mediators; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Arthritis; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Inflammatory Response; inhibitor/antagonist; innate immune function; Innate Immune System; interest; Interferons; Knowledge; Liver; loss of function; Lung; MAP Kinase Gene; MHC Class II Genes; mouse model; Multiple Sclerosis; Mutation; nanomolar; novel; Operative Surgical Procedures; outcome prediction; pathogen; Pathway interactions; Patients; Peptidoglycan; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacologic Substance; Pharmacology; Phosphorylation; Phosphotransferases; Physiological; Play; potential biomarker; pre-clinical trial; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Proteins; Proteomics; public health relevance; response; RIPK2 gene; Role; Sarcoidosis; screening; Serine; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Specificity; Threonine; TNF gene; transcriptome sequencing; transcriptomics; Translating; translational medicine; Treatment Efficacy; Tyrosine; Ubiquitin; Uncertainty; Work"
"1R21DC015982-01A1","DISCOVERING THE FUNCTION OF A PUTATIVE ION CHANNEL FAMILY LINKED TO INHERITED DISEASES","ABBOTT, GEOFFREY W","ABBOTT, GEOFFREY W","There are eight known Transmembrane channel-like (TMC) isoforms in the human TMC gene family (TMC1-8),
several of which are linked to inherited human diseases. The disease linkages, and the contrasting and
generally wide tissue distribution of the TMC genes, indicate the importance of this gene family to human
physiology and pathophysiology. Yet, despite numerous studies, the precise function of mammalian TMC
proteins, which share no homology with other gene families, has remained enigmatic. Recent elegant studies
relying upon recordings in auditory hair cells from mice with Tmc1 and/or Tmc2 genes deleted strongly suggest
a role in hair cell mechanotransduction, explaining the linkage of these genes to inherited deafness. However,
despite great interest, direct functional analysis of mammalian TMC gene function has been hampered by an
inability to express TMC proteins at the cell surface in heterologous expression systems, to facilitate study of
their putative roles as ion channels or their regulatory subunits. The TMC gene family therefore constitutes a
rare entity: an orphan gene family of uncertain function, with several established disease linkages. Seeking to
address this major gap in knowledge, we hypothesized that TMC proteins require other proteins to reach the
cell surface. We developed a simple surface expression screen and discovered that TMC1 surface expression
is specifically rescued by the KCNQ1 voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel a subunit. We have also
discovered that TMC1 inhibits the typical KCNQ1 current, instead forming a new current with novel attributes.
The data define human TMC1 as a novel type of channel subunit, paving the way for long-awaited functional
studies of mammalian TMC genes. We now propose to define mechanisms of TMC1 function and
pathobiology, and to open up the rest of the TMC family to functional study by us and other groups, as quickly
as possible, to facilitate future discovery of therapeutic approaches for TMC-linked human diseases. In Aim 1,
we will test fundamental hypotheses regarding the functional role of TMC1 in complexes with KCNQ1,
determining how TMC1 is activated and which functional properties of KCNQ1 are altered by TMC1 and vice
versa. In Aim 2, with an innovative application of a high-throughput surface exposure assay followed by two
different high-throughput functional assays (fluorescence-based and electrophysiological) we will test the
hypothesis that all eight TMC proteins are ion channel subunits, and that they form complexes with other
members of the forty-strong Kv a subunit gene family. The overall goal is to discover the basic functional
mechanistic attributes of one of the few remaining enigmatic disease-linked human ion channel gene families.","Narrative
TMC proteins are encoded by an eight-member human gene family, several members of which are linked to

proposed project is directed toward uncovering mechanisms of ion channel function of TMC genes and thus
enabling future development of therapeutics to prevent, treat or cure TMC-linked diseases - most notably

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The KCNQ1 voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel pore-forming (a) subunit is ubiquitously expressed and linked to life-threatening human disorders including Long QT syndrome, atrial fibrillation and diabetes. KCNQ1 exhibits a high degree of functional flexibility enabled by co-assembly with KCNE family ß subunits, facilitating roles both in excitable cell repolarization, and as a constitutively active K+ channel in polarized
epithelial cells. Na+-coupled solute transport is crucial for uptake of ions and solutes including sugars and myo-inositol, an important osmolyte and precursor for cell signaling molecules. We recently discovered that KCNQ1 forms complexes with several different Na+-coupled solute transporters, and that at least two of these novel complexes are required for normal epithelial cell activity - in the thyroid and choroid plexus. Using in vitro functional studies, we found that
KCNQ1 and the Na+-dependent myo-inositol transporters SMIT1 and SMIT2 reciprocally regulate each other's function. We also recently identified several other channel-transporter interactions, including KCNQ4-SMIT1, KCNQ1-SGLT1 (Na+-coupled glucose transporter), and KCNQ1-NIS (Na+/I- symporter). Here, we will elucidate molecular mechanisms of function, interaction, and physiological relevance of this novel and potentially widespread class of macromolecular signaling complexes. Three main questions are addressed. First, which channel domains and functions regulate transporter activity? Using mutagenesis, pharmacological agents and functional analyses, we will test the hypothesis that the KCNQ1 pore and voltage sensor modules can independently influence activity of co-assembled solute transporters. We will also use protein biochemistry in conjunction with channel chimeras and mutagenesis to elucidate channel domains crucial for physical interaction with transporters, in vitro. Second, why are channel-transporter complexes required? Using electrophysiological and solute uptake assays in vitro we will test the hypothesis that KCNQ1 acts as a biosensor in complexes with SMIT1 and SMIT2, facilitating responses to changes in osmolarity, membrane lipid composition, pH and Ca2+. Third, where do channel-transporter complexes occur in vivo? Aided by several knockout mouse lines, we will locate channel-transporter complexes, and utilize positron emission tomography to specifically test for the requirement of KCNQ1-KCNE regulation of SGLT family transporters, in vivo. Na+-coupled solute transporters, and Kv channel a subunits including KCNQ1, exhibit broad distribution, wide tissue expression overlap, and high biomedical significance. Together with our recent findings, this suggests that potassium channel-transporter complexes have the potential to be highly influential in mammalian physiology and in the pathogenesis of a number of prevalent human disorders.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Voltage-gated ion channels control electrical activity in the body and are essential for processes including thought and movement, breathing and the heart-beat. Sodium-coupled solute transporters also regulate these activities and are essential for cellular uptake of vital ions and nutrients. Having recently discovered that proteins in these two classes interact, we will now uncover mechanisms for these interactions, and how they are regulated, to better understand their roles in human health and disease.","Address; Atrial Fibrillation; Basic Science; behavior test; Biochemical; Biological Assay; Biosensor; Breathing; Calmodulin; Cells; Cellular biology; Cerebrospinal Fluid; Chimera organism; Chinese Hamster Ovary Cell; Choroid Plexus Epithelium; Co-Immunoprecipitations; Complement; Complex; Coupled; Data; Diabetes Mellitus; Disease; Electrophysiology (science); Employee Strikes; Epithelial; Epithelial Cells; Exhibits; extracellular; Family; flexibility; Fluorescent Antibody Technique; Future; Gated Ion Channel; Glucose Transporter; Glucosides; Health; Heart; Human; In Vitro; in vitro Assay; in vivo; Influentials; Inositol; Ion Channel; Ion Channel Gating; Ions; Knock-in Mouse; knockout gene; Knockout Mice; Life; Link; Long QT Syndrome; Mass Spectrum Analysis; member; Membrane; Membrane Lipids; Molecular; Molecular Conformation; Movement; Mus; Mutagenesis; mutant; Mutation; nervous system disorder; novel; Nutrient; Osmolar Concentration; Pathogenesis; Pharmacology; Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases; Physiological; Physiology; Positron-Emission Tomography; Potassium; Potassium Channel; precursor cell; Process; Production; Property; Protein Biochemistry; Protein Isoforms; Proteins; public health relevance; Regulation; response; Role; scyllo-inositol; sensor; Signal Transduction; Signaling Molecule; Site; Site-Directed Mutagenesis; Sodium; solute; Sphingomyelinase; Stereoisomer; Structure of choroid plexus; sugar; symporter; Testing; Thyroid Gland; Tissues; uptake; voltage; Xenopus oocyte"
"5R01DC013168-04","MAGNETIC GUIDANCE FOR IMPROVED COCHLEAR-IMPLANT INSERTION","ABBOTT, JAKE","ABBOTT, JAKE","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Approximately 25 million Americans suffer from sensorineural hearing loss, which is a condition where the cochlea is unable to convert sound into nerve impulses to the brain.  A cochlear implant (CI) is an array of electrodes that is surgically inserted into the cochlea to electrically stimulate the nerves responsible for hearing. 
As the CI is inserted into the scala tympani, delicate intracochlear structures are often damaged, which can result in decreased implant effectiveness and loss of residual hearing, especially when the implant deviates into the adjacent scala vestibuli chamber via rupture of the basilar membrane, which occurs in approximately 33% of insertions.  The goal of reducing surgical trauma is especially compelling given that electric acoustic stimulation, which is a relatively new
treatment directed at individuals with a considerable amount of residual hearing in the low-frequency range, is receiving greater interest, but requires atraumatic insertions to preserve the patient's residual hearing.  The goal of this project is to demonstrate that magnetic guidance of CIs will reduce trauma relative to manual insertion.  Magnetic guidance will be accomplished with an inexpensive clinical system, based on proven robotic and magnetic technologies developed by the investigators.  In the proposed work, the investigators will pursue three specific aims:  (1) They will test the conjecture that magnetic guidance will reduce insertion forces and forces against the basilar membrane compared to manual insertions, using a CI with a magnet embedded in the distal tip.  Tasks include developing cochlear phantoms for experimentation, determining optimal placement of the magnetic manipulator relative to the patient, segmenting the patient's scala tympani and registering it with respect to the magnetic manipulator and insertion device, developing magnetic-guidance algorithms for free-fitting and precurved CIs for both cochleostomy and round-window insertions, developing real-time force control to be combined with magnetic guidance for improved safety and robustness, and determining if high-frequency vibration of the CI provides addition benefits.  (2) They will test te conjecture that the magnet can be safely removed after CI insertion, such that the patient would not be precluded from future MRI scans.  Tasks include developing a method for magnet attachment/detachment to the CI, ensuring that the cochlea is not harmed due to heating during the detachment process, and developing a method to safely remove the magnet after detachment from the CI.  (3) They will verify the methods developed in the first two aims in human cadaver temporal bones combined with micro CT scans, and in live guinea pigs combined with auditory brainstem response hearing tests and histology.  This project is directly relevant to the mission of the NIDCD ""to create devices which substitute for lost and impaired sensory and communication function."" More specifically, in the 2012-2016 NIDCD Strategic Plan, in the Priority Area of Hearing and Balance Research, Priority Area 3 includes improved interventions for hearing loss, including cochlear implants.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Approximately 25 million Americans suffer from sensorineural hearing loss, which is a condition in which the cochlea is unable to convert sound into nerve impulses to the brain.

"1R21EY027528-01","QUANTIFYING THE BENEFITS OF HEAD-MOUNTING IN TELEMANIPULATED ROBOTIC EYE THERAPIES","ABBOTT, JAKE","ABBOTT, JAKE","PROJECT SUMMARY
Many of the up-and-coming therapeutic protocols in ophthalmology are technically difficult, near or beyond the
limits of human ability, and are being attempted by only a few surgeons. Examples include subretinal injection
of stem cells or gene therapies, which have the potential to restore sight but that cannot currently be delivered
safely and repeatably, and the deep anterior lamellar karatoplasty (DALK) method for corneal transplantation,
which eliminates the risk of transplant rejection but currently has a high failure rate. Surgeon hand tremor
combined with patient movement due to breathing and snoring place a lower limit on achievable precision. The
recent availability of optical coherence tomography (OCT), including new surgical microscopes with OCT
embedded in the eyepieces, makes it easy to image the magnified retina and cornea, as well as the instrument
relative to the tissue. However, positioning precision is the bottleneck. The investigators have developed a
robotic manipulator that is more precise than all prior systems designed for robot-assisted eye surgery, and
which is small and light enough to realistically be mounted to the head of the patient. The motivation for the
prior support for the project was the potential benefit of head-mounting, with the hypothesis being that passive
compensation of head movement (combined with the tremor canceling and scaling inherent to
telemanipulation) will enable levels of precision that are currently unachievable by any means. However, to
date, the benefit of head-mounting in robot-assisted ophthalmology has simply been assumed by the clinicians
and engineers involved. Testing this hypothesis, and quantifying the benefit, is the critical remaining step that
will be addressed in this project. This project comprises two specific aims, which are to quantify the positioning
accuracy and precision of the head-mounted telemanipulated robotic system under OCT guidance, and
compare to the results for manual abilities, for the applications of subretinal injection and DALK-method
corneal transplantation. The specific aims will be addressed through human-subjects testing with experienced
retinal and corneal-transplant surgeons. In order to conduct these experiments, the investigators will develop a
robotic head that mimics the breathing and snoring of a patient, which can accommodate a pig eye in its eye
socket. They will also develop a device to mount the robotic manipulator to the robotic head in a minimally
invasive way, based on an existing device developed for surgical registration. The primary purpose of this
exploratory/developmental project is to generate preliminary data to pursue R01 funding for two independent
research projects involving robot-assisted subretinal injections of therapeutic agents and robot-assisted
corneal transplantation, respectively.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Many of the up-and-coming surgeries and therapies in ophthalmology are technically difficult, near or beyond
the limits of the ability of most surgeons. The investigators will test the hypothesis that robot-assisted methods
in which the robot is mounted directly to the patient's head, to account for patient movement due to breathing
and snoring, are the key to performing these important procedures safely and repeatably.","Address; Air; Anesthesia procedures; Anterior; base; Breathing; Bulla; Cadaver; Cannulas; Cornea; Corneal Stroma; Data; Descemet's membrane; design; Development; Devices; Endothelium; Engineering; experience; experimental study; Eye; Failure; Family suidae; Financial compensation; Funding; gene therapy; Graft Rejection; Hand; Head; Head Movements; high risk; Human; human subject; Image; Industry; Injectable; Injection of therapeutic agent; instrument; Keratoplasty; Light; Liquid substance; Manuals; Measures; Methods; Microscope; minimally invasive; Monitor; Motion; Motivation; Movement; Needles; novel therapeutics; Ocular orbit; Operative Surgical Procedures; Ophthalmologic Surgical Procedures; Ophthalmology; Optical Coherence Tomography; Outcome; Patients; Pattern; Penetrating Keratoplasty; Pilot Projects; Positioning Attribute; Procedures; Protocols documentation; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; Retina; Retinal; Risk; Robot; robot assistance; Robotics; Rupture; Saline; Scanning; Snoring; stem cell therapy; Structure of retinal pigment epithelium; Study Subject; subretinal injection; success; Surgeon; Surgical incisions; Syringes; System; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Agents; Thick; Tissues; Transplant Surgeon; Tremor; Universities; Vision; Visual; Vitrectomy"

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a resubmission of a request for continuation of our Institutional NRSA, funded since 1975 for post-graduate training of MDs and PhDs in the University of Iowa Cardiovascular Research Center. All concerns of the Review Committee have been addressed in the Introduction. A large cadre of established investigators will serve as mentors for each of 13 trainees. Most of the 48 scientists who serve as primary mentors have been leaders and collaborators in major NIH funded research programs for several years. The research programs focus on 5 areas: Membrane Biology, Ion Channels, and Cell Signaling; Integrative Neurobiology and Sensory Signals in Cardiovascular Regulation; Endothelial/Vascular Biology, Atherosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Cerebral Circulation; and Hypertension. Multidisciplinary themes and core resources cut across these major research areas. The emphasis is on basic, clinical, and translational research and a primary goal of an academic career. Most trainees will require from 4 to 6 years of advanced training in expectation of a career as independent investigators. A plan is outlined with support from this training grant for 1 to 3 years and the remaining years funded by institutional sources or other NIH, foundation or American Heart Association career development programs. The trainees participate in seminars, graduate courses, bench research, genomic and clinical research, and epidemiologic surveys and biostatistics. Several courses will be mandatory for individuals seeking MS or PhD degrees and for all trainees in Responsible Conduct of Research. Our resources include the only medical school in the state of Iowa, one of the largest University-owned hospitals, the VA Medical Center, a College of Public Health, and a Cardiovascular Research Center of eminent national and international recognition. Our strengths are 1) the recruitment and retention of established investigators; 2) the cohesive interaction between basic scientists and clinical investigators providing an excellent environment for training of PhDs and MDs side by side; 3) the record of success in training outstanding cardiovascular scientists; and 4) the breadth and depth of research opportunities, and superb institutional commitment. Several important new developments have positioned us very favorably to continue to provide an outstanding environment for training cardiovascular scientists. These are: the renewal of 5 major program project grants, the creation of a new Institute for Clinical and Translational Research with a funded CTSA, the building of a new Institute of Biomedical Discovery, and the funding of a $25M endowment for research in diabetes and its cardiovascular consequences. In this renewal, we place greater emphasis on multidisciplinary collaborations, the link between basic and translational science, mentoring and evaluations, and recruitment of unrepresented minorities. The discovery of the causes of cardiovascular disease and of ways to prevent them and cure the patients who are suffering, requires dedicated physicians and scientists to devote their lifelong work to a health mission without which a civilized society would not survive. Such individuals require years of training in medical science beyond their professional degree under the tutelage and mentoring of established senior medical investigators/teachers working in an environment with exceptional intellectual, technical, and physical resources. At the University of Iowa Cardiovascular Research Center, we have provided a world-renowned training center since 1975, have graduated hundreds of scientists, many of whom are national leaders throughout the USA, and aim to continue to do so for future generations with the renewal of federal support that we are applying for and hope to attain.

events, independent of conventional risk factors. However, the mechanisms underiying this link are 
unknown, and it has never been proved that treating anxiety reduces cardiovascular risk. This project will 
address these important issues. We have gathered compelling data demonstrating that even modest anxiety 
symptoms are associated with sympathetic nerve activation, inflammation, and profound impairment of 
resistance vessel function in humans. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we will address three speciflc 
aims: 1) Does anxietv produce vascular dvsfunction through increased inflammation or oxidant stress? We 
will measure ex vivo endothelial cell proteins reflecting inflammation and oxidant stress in subjects with 
anxiety symptom scores in the highest and lowest quartiles. We will then test whether anti-inflammatory 
(salsalate) and anti-oxidant (ascorbic acid) interventions reverse vascular dysfunction in high compared to 
low anxiety subjects. This aim will additionally examine whether peripheral resistance vessel dysfunction is 
also present in the brain using functional MRI to measure cerebral blood flow, and whether this is improved 
by salsalate. 2) Does anxietv produce vascular dysfunction through svmpathetic activation? We will test 
whether sympathetic inhibition with clonidine for 4 weeks improves inflammation, oxidant stress and vascular 
dysfunction to a greater degree in high than low anxiety subjects. 3) Does treatment of anxietv improve 
svmpathetic activation, inflammation, oxidant stress and Vascular dvsfunction? We will randomly assign 
subjects with high anxiety to a novel mindfulness-based acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) or time 
control. This therapy has been shown in our hands and others to have substantial and durable effects on 
anxiety symptoms. We will test whether ACT produces signiflcantly greater improvements in 
microneurographic sympathetic nerve activity, endothelial cell proteins reflecting inflammation and oxidant 
stress, and forearm resistance vessel function. This project should: A) Provide compelling evidence that 
anxiety causes vascular damage. B) Elucidate mechanisms involved in the effects of anxiety on the 
vasculature. C) Help develop novel phenotypes for future research on anxiety classiflcation, severity and 
treatment. D) Suggest new strategies for cardiovascular risk stratiflcation and prevention. We will achieve 
these goals through a distinctive multidisciplinary collaboration between investigators expert in 
cardiovascular biology, psychiatry, behavioral psychology and neuroimaging.","Anxiety is a psychiatric condition found in about 20% ofthe US population, which has been linked to 
increased risk for heart attack and stroke. We propose to examine the reasons for this association, and test 
agents that block inflammation and the sympathetic nervous system in patients with low and high levels of 
anxiety. We will also examine whether treating anxiety reduces sympathetic activation and vascular damage.

an important role in hypertension. Two recent observations provide the background for our proposal. One
is the flnding that the vagus exerts an anti-inflammatory influence on the immune system by activating a-7
nicotinic cholinergic receptors. The other is the essential contribution of the adaptive immune system and T
lymphocytes to chronic angiotensin II dependent hypertension. Our focus is on the role ofthe innate immune
system in a genetic model of hypertension, the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). Our early results
recentiy published in Circulation Research indicate that nicotine exerts an anti-inflammatory influence on
splenocytes of Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats in contrast to a marked proinflammatory response seen in spleno-
cytes of SHR prior to the onset of hypertension.
Hypothesis. The innate immune system in genetic hypertension is abnormally regulated by the autonomic
nervous system to trigger proinflammatory responses to endogenous antigens. These induce pathologic
renal and vascular changes that initiate and sustain the hypertensive state.
Experimental Plan. The intracellular toll-like receptors (TLR) 7/8 and 9 will be activated with speciflc ligands
to induce cytokine release and upregulate proinflammatory genes in isolated splenocytes and in vivo. Re-
sponses will be obtained prenatally and at various ages in WKY and in SHR as hypertension develops and
progresses. Regulation of TLR-induced inflammatory responses by activation of nicotinic cholinergic or Ang
II ATI receptors will conflrm the importance of neurohormonal receptors on the innate immune system and
hence on the hypertensive state. The phenotypic expression of hypertension and end-organ renal and vas-
cular damage will be correlated with the gene and protein expressions in those tissues and their inflltration
with immune cells. We will attempt to induce hypertension in WKY by prolonged activation of TLRs and in
Fl hybrids (SHR-WKY) by adoptive transfer of splenocytes and bone marrow from SHR. The importance
of TLR activation and the regulatory influence of nicotinic cholinergic or ATI receptors will be tested in the
mouse model of chronic ang ll-induced hypertension.
Anticipated results. The results will establish the importance of innate immune system in triggering the
inflammatory cascade that leads to hypertension. The regulatory influence of nicotinic and ATI receptors
deflne a new and important putative therapeutic intervention in hypertension and cardiovascular disease.
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
Relevance. A novel concept deflnes the importance of the.innate immune system in initiating the
inflammatory cascade in hypertension. The correlation between the expression of proinflammatory genes
and end-organ damage establishes pathological relevance and raises the hopeful prospect of putative
therapeutic interventions.","activator 1 protein; Adaptive Immune System; Address; Adoptive Transfer; Age; Agonist; Angiotensin II; Anti-inflammatory; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Antigens; Autonomic nervous system; Blood Circulation; Blood Pressure; Blood Vessels; Bone Marrow; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cardiovascular system; Cells; cholinergic; Cholinergic Receptors; Chronic; cytokine; Dendritic Cells; Development; Dexamethasone; experimental study; familial hypertension; Flow Cytometry; Fostering; Gene Expression; gene induction; Genes; Genetic Models; Glucocorticoid Receptor; Hybrids; Hypertension; Immune; Immune system; Immunity; in utero; in vivo; Inbred SHR Rats; Inbred WKY Rats; Individual; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Response; Infusion procedures; Innate Immune Response; Innate Immune System; Instruction; Interleukin-6; Kidney; kidney vascular structure; Ligands; macrophage; Maintenance; Marrow; Measurement; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; Mesentery; Molecular; Molecular Profiling; mouse model; Mus; Natural Immunity; Natural Killer Cells; Nature; Neurobiology; NF-kappa B; Nicotine; novel; Organ; overexpression; Pathologic; Phenotype; Play; Population; prenatal; Process; protein expression; Publishing; Rattus; receptor; Receptor Activation; Regulation; Research; response; Role; Serum; Spleen; Splenocyte; T-Lymphocyte; Testing; Therapeutic Intervention; Tissues; TLR7 gene; TNF gene; Toll-like receptors; Transcription Factor AP-1; Transgenic Organisms",NA

Now in its 40th year, it represents a major scientific emphasis of the Cardiovascular Research Center at lowa. The strength of this renewal is based on the cohesion and synergy of its senior leadership, its constant evolution in concepts and approaches with new investigators and the continuum of the effort from discovery of mechanisms to their translation into disease states in animal models and humans. The four projects represent a functional integration of central neurohormonal processes which through interdependent molecular mechanisms involving neuroplasticity, oxidation, and inflammation induce pathological states of anxiety, hypertension and vascular damage. Project I: ""Sites and Mechanisms of CNS Neuroplasticity in the Sensitization of Hypertension"" (Johnson, Kwitek) explores mechanisms that induce hypertension through the upregulation of signaling molecules in the key brain nuclei comprising the Angiotensin/Aldosterone sensitive components of the neural network controlling blood pressure. Project II: ""Does Anxiety Cause Vascular Dysfunction Through Inflammation and Sympathetic Activation?"" (Haynes, Fiedorowicz, Pierce) considers vascular dysfunction peripherally as well as centrally (cerebrally) as pathological underpinnings of an inflammatory oxidative process that increases sympathetic activity and cardiovascular risks in humans with severe anxiety. Project III: ""Neurohormonal Regulation of the Innate Immune System is Proinflammatory in a Genetic Model of Hypertension"" (Abboud, Ballas, Zavazava) identifies a strong regulatory influence of cholinergic and ATI receptors on the inflammatory immune pathological process in hypertension with vascular and renal damage. Project IV: ""Methionine Sulfoxide Reductase A: a novel Molecular Determinant of Autonomic Regulation and Hypertensive End-Organ Damage"" (Chapleau, Anderson, Weiss) explores the ability to target changes in the oxidative process to specific brain sites and vascular muscle and thereby alter the course of hypertension and vascular pathology. Novel concepts about inflammatory and oxidative processes in hypertension and vasculopathy are explored. The technical approaches and animal models are well established, and there is a thematic translational convergence of molecular mechanisms in hypertension, anxiety, dysautonomia and vascular pathology. Common threads create the intellectual fabric where the integrated outcome will be far greater than the sum of the components.","Hypertension and vascular damage are the most common causes of cardiovascular mortality, and anxiety 
in humans increases cardiovascular risks significantly. The four projects we propose will define molecular 
mechanisms that involve pathological processes of neuroplasticity, oxidation, and inflammation in animal

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cochlear function changes throughout the human lifespan in a continuum of maturation and aging. Otoacoustic emissions (OAE) provide a non-invasive window into the cochlea and the mechanisms driving these changes. Here, we apply OAEs to map age-related shifts in cochlear mechanics and explore the potential for new probes of hearing. In Aim 1 we exploit the robust reflection generated by neonatal ears and record stimulus frequency (SF) OAEs, a reflection-source emission, in newborns. SFOAEs have been linked to cochlear tuning and gain yet have never been characterized in newborns, mostly because of their need for prohibitively long protocols to achieve adequate signal-to-noise ratios. This problem is rendered tractable by novel algorithms allowing for the rapid presentation of stimuli as sweeping tones. We will characterize the SFOAE for the first time in a large cohort of newborn ears and adapt the innovative swept-tone algorithm for optimal use within this age group. Aim 2 studies the apical portion of the newborn and adult cochlea, a region representing nearly half of our audible frequency range, yet poorly understood and wholly unexplored during maturation. In newborn ears, non-adult-like DPOAE phase has been observed for low-frequency signals; we hypothesize that subtle immaturities in the apical frequency-place map may account for these findings. Here, seek converging evidence from reflection- and distortion-source OAEs, record and model DPOAE apical phase maps, and conduct histological analysis of human temporal bones to link apical anatomy to OAE features during development. Changes in cochlear mechanics do not cease after infancy; the aging ear experiences documented changes in the health of its sensory cells and in its metabolic environment, producing altered cochlear efficiency. Cochlear-based deficits contribute to perceptual difficulties common to older listeners. In Aim 3, we hypothesize that one such deficit is the loss of cochlear nonlinearity in the aging ear, and we define how OAE-based metrics of nonlinearity change from middle-age through senescence. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the cochlea becomes more ""rough"" with aging, possibly accounting for its ability to generate reflection emissions despite declining cochlear health. These three aims apply diverse experimental and theoretical tools and break new ground; they characterize SFOAEs in newborns as a first step in exploring their potential as a neonatal hearing screen, probe the oft-neglected apical half of the human cochlea where neonatal immaturities have been observed, and define how cochlear nonlinearities and OAE generation change in the aging ear.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The cochlea changes throughout the continuum of human maturation and aging. Here, we apply innovative otoacoustic emissions methods to map the time course for age-related shifts, and study the mechanisms driving these changes and the impact they have on perception. By understanding normal cochlear function throughout the human lifespan, we hope to develop more effective probes of hearing.","Accounting; Adult; Age; age effect; age group; age related; Aging; Algorithms; Anatomy; Apical; Auditory; Automobile Driving; base; Birth; Cells; clinical efficacy; Cochlea; cohort; Development; Ear; Elderly; Environment; experience; experimental study; Frequencies; Generations; Health; Hearing; hearing impairment; hearing screening; Histologic; Histology; Human; improved; infancy; Infant; innovation; Ipsilateral; Link; Longevity; Maps; Measurement; Measures; Mechanics; Metabolic; Methods; middle age; Modeling; Morphologic artifacts; neglect; Neonatal; Newborn Infant; Noise; novel; Output; Perception; Perinatal; Phase; phenomenological models; Population; Protocols documentation; public health relevance; Residual state; Resolution; senescence; Sensory; Signal Transduction; Source; Spontaneous Otoacoustic Emissions; Stimulus; Temporal bone structure; Testing; Time; Time Study; tool"
"1R01MH112668-01","GLIAL AND SYNAPTIC FUNCTIONS IN MAJOR DEPRESSION","ABDALLAH, CHADI","ABDALLAH, CHADI","PROJECT SUMMARY
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a disabling, often chronic, mental illness with not fully understood
pathophysiology and high treatment resistance to currently available antidepressants. Accumulating evidence
suggests that glial and glutamate synaptic abnormalities play an essential role in the pathophysiology of MDD
and may offer a powerful treatment target. However, a major obstacle in the field is the paucity of human in
vivo biomarkers of glial function and glutamate neurotransmission; markers that could serve as indices of
target engagement and target validation. These biomarkers are urgently needed to facilitate early stages of drug
development, and perhaps reduce the failure rate of clinical trials. The proposed project capitalizes on recent
advances in 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (13C MRS) to examine in vivo glial and synaptic functions in
MDD, and to establish the potential utility of 3 biomarkers: 1) glial oxidative metabolism (VTCAg), a
translational cell specific biomarker that was previously related in rodents to depression pathology and
treatment, but never tested in humans. 2) Neuronal energy production over glutamate cycling (VTCAn/Vcycle), a
marker of glutamate neurotransmission highly conserved across animals and humans that is resilient to
various potential neuroimaging confounds. 3) Global brain connectivity (GBC), a novel graph-based resting
state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) measure that was recently shown to be altered in MDD and to be
highly sensitive to treatment response to the glutamate modulator ketamine, a rapid acting antidepressant.
The proposed project will complete rs-fcMRI and prefrontal 13C-acetate MRS scans in 3 study groups: 1) MDD
patients on stable treatment with a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, who are resistant to their treatment regimen
and continue to suffer from significant depression symptoms (SRI), 2) un-medicated MDD patients currently
depressed (nSRI), and 3) healthy controls free of psychopathology (HC). These studies will aim to demonstrate
reduced prefrontal VTCAg and VTCAn/Vcycle in depressed patients regardless of treatment status. This will be
interpreted as evidence of altered prefrontal glial metabolism and synaptic transmission. It will also suggest
that these biomarkers may be sensitive to treatment failure. The project will also aim to demonstrate altered
prefrontal global connectivity regardless of treatment status, while most importantly providing new evidence of
a link between synaptic measures of glutamate neurotransmission and large scale intrinsic networks. Together,
the data will apply novel tools in the study of MDD and, if the study hypotheses were confirmed, the provided
evidence could offer unique biomarkers of glial and synaptic function in MDD. Furthermore, considering the
critical role of glial and glutamate neurotransmission in brain functioning, the specific data generated in MDD
could be of relevance to several psychiatric illnesses, in particular stress-related disorders.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Clinical depression is a debilitating mental illness afflicting millions of patients who are refractory to currently
available antidepressants. This project aims to establish novel biological markers of depression that are 1)
closely related to synaptic transmission, 2) could be acquired in animals and humans, and 3) sensitive to
detecting treatment failure. If these aims were accomplished, the established biomarkers may serve a major
role in drug discovery and expediting early stages of drug development.","Acetates; Animals; Antidepressive Agents; Atrophic; Autopsy; base; Biological Markers; biomarker identification; biosignature; Brain; brain circuitry; Brain region; Cell Respiration; Cells; Chronic stress; Clinical; Clinical Trials; cohort; connectome; Data; Depressed mood; depressed patient; depressive symptoms; design; Development; disability; Disease; Distress; drug development; drug discovery; excitotoxicity; Failure; frontal lobe; Functional disorder; Glutamates; Glutamine; Graph; gray matter; Human; Impairment; in vivo; indexing; insight; Ketamine; Link; Literature; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Major Depressive Disorder; Measures; member; Mental Depression; Mental disorders; Metabolism; Methods; Molecular; Negative Valence; neuroimaging; neuronal metabolism; Neurons; neurotransmission; novel; Participant; Pathology; Patients; Play; Pre-Clinical Model; Prefrontal Cortex; Production; Psychopathology; Refractory; Research; Research Domain Criteria; Resistance; Rest; Rodent; Role; Scanning; Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor; severe mental illness; specific biomarkers; stable isotope; Standardization; stress related disorder; Suicide; symptom treatment; Synapses; synaptic function; Synaptic Transmission; System; Testing; therapy resistant; tool; Treatment Failure; Treatment Protocols; treatment response; Validation"

infarction (AMI). AMI and the subsequent ischemic heart disease (IHD) are often complicated with high 
mortality and poor overall prognosis despite significant advances in medical therapy and revascularization 
strategies. Currently, short of heart transplantation with all of its inherit limitations, there are no available 
treatment strategies that replace the infracted myocardium and therapies are largely palliative. Paradoxically, 
obesity may also confer a protective effect against AMI-associated remodeling which leads to IHD. The 
molecular basis for this protection is poorly understood. AMI initiates poorly understood innate reparatory 
mechanisms through which BMSPCs are mobilized and home towards the ischemic myocardium 
contributing to myocardial regeneration and correlating with cardiac recovery. Our preliminary data indicates 
that bioactive lipids such as sphingosine-1 phosphate (SIP), but not traditional chemokines, play a 
quintessential role in this mobilization and homing. Interestingly, obesity and the associated metabolic 
syndrome are associated with alterations in bioactive lipids' metabolism. Our objective in this application, 
therefore, is to develop better understanding of the obesity-associated alterations in AMI-induced stem cell 
mobilization pathways, specially those involving bioactive lipids, and devise therapies that harness this 
process for therapeutic myocardial regeneration strategies. Our central hypothesis has been formulated 
based upon the existing literature and our strong preliminary data demonstrating that BMSPCs express SIP 
receptors and will migrate towards plasma from AMI patients in an SI P dependent fashion. Our rationale for 
these studies is that understanding the protective role of bioactive lipids and stem cell mobilization during 
AMI in obesity would help establish a strong scientific framework for eventual generalizable human 
myocardial regenerative clinical trials utilizing the available and new pharmacological modulators of bioactive 
lipids and their receptors. In addition to clinical studies, our approach will exploit small molecule-strategies in 
mouse models through examining the obesity associated molecular and cellular pathways, specially those 
involving bioactive lipids, that are activated by myocardial infarction (Aim 1); and examine the modulation of 
bioactive lipids' metabolism and receptor expression to enhance cardiac recovery following AMI (Aim 2).","Obesity increases the risk for acute myocardial infarction but may paradoxically exert protective effect from

"1R01HL138488-01","LYSOPHOSPHATIDIC ACID MEDIATES CARDIAC INFLAMMATION AFTER ACUTE INFARCTION","ABDEL-LATIF, AHMED","ABDEL-LATIF, AHMED","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. population and is often caused
by acute myocardial infarction (AMI). AMI initiates an inflammatory response leading to increased circulating
inflammatory bone marrow cells (BMCs), particularly monocytes (monocytosis). This response is crucial for
removing dead tissue and initiating the healing process. However, exacerbated inflammatory response following
AMI can be detrimental and is associated with infarct expansion, poor cardiac remodeling and adverse clinical
outcomes. While most studies focus on monocyte production following AMI, the mechanism(s) of monocyte
egress from the bone marrow and early cardiac infiltration after AMI are poorly understood. Our preliminary data
demonstrate the role of the signaling bioactive lipid, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), in the post-AMI mobilization of
BMCs. LPA, produced by the enzyme autotaxin (ATX), plays a key role in activating inflammatory monocytes,
regulating their peripheral blood count and homing them to sites of inflammation. Preliminary studies also
indicated that LPA levels are elevated early in PB and cardiac tissues after AMI in humans and mice. The long-
term goal is to contribute to development of new clinically useful therapies for AMI injury. The overall objective
of this application is to define LPA mediated signaling pathways linking AMI to the inflammatory BM response.
The rationale for the proposed research is its potential to offer new approaches to reduce inflammation and
improve cardiac recovery after AMI. The central hypothesis is that LPA plays a key role in initiating and
maintaining the post-AMI inflammatory response, thus impairing cardiac recovery. This hypothesis will be tested
by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Identify the molecular mechanism(s) that result in elevated plasma LPA after
AMI, 2) Determine the signaling systems by which ATX/LPA axis promotes monocytosis after AMI, and 3) define
the association between LPA levels, heritable genetic variability in LPA receptor 1 that predicts receptor
expression and monocytosis after AMI in humans. Results of these studies are expected to provide new
mechanistic understanding of AMI-induced ATX/LPA signaling, their contribution to AMI-associated systemic
monocytosis and cardiac inflammation and the role of heritable genetic mutations in monocytosis and
inflammation in humans. To attain this goal, the proposed project will combine human studies with animal models
with genetic manipulation of key components of the ATX/LPA signaling. This group has extensive experience in
studying heart/BM signaling after AMI as well as ATX/LPA signaling pathways. The overall impact of these
studies derives from an innovative focus on the ATX/LPA signaling nexus as a critical mechanism in AMI-induc ed
inflammation and the potential to control post-AMI infarct expansion and subsequent heart failure by dampening
this pathological response.","The proposed research is relevant to health care in that ischemic heart disease following acute myocardial
infarction (AMI) continues to be the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the U.S. The bone marrow
responds to myocardial injury by the production and mobilization of inflammatory cells that can exacerbate the
injury and our proposal aims at reducing this pathological inflammation and subsequent development of heart
failure. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH’s mission pertaining to developing and applying
fundamental knowledge to protect and improve the health of the public.","Acute; Acute myocardial infarction; Address; Adhesions; Affect; Animal Model; Atherosclerosis; base; Blood; Blood Vessels; Bone Marrow; Bone Marrow Cells; Cardiac; Cardiac Myocytes; cardiogenesis; Cells; Cessation of life; chemokine; Chemotactic Factors; Clinical; Complement; Coupled; cytokine; Data; Development; DNA Sequence Alteration; Endothelial Cells; Enzymes; experience; Frequencies; G-substrate; Gap Junctions; Genetic; genetic manipulation; genetic variant; Goals; GTP-Binding Proteins; gustin; healing; Healthcare; Heart; Heart failure; Heritability; Homing; Human; Impairment; improved; Infarction; Infiltration; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Response; inhibitor/antagonist; Injury; innovation; Knowledge; Link; Lipids; lysophosphatidic acid; Lysophosphatidic Acid Receptors; Lysophospholipids; Mass Spectrum Analysis; Mediating; Metabolism; Mission; Modeling; Molecular; monocyte; Monocytosis; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; mouse model; Mus; Myelopoiesis; Myocardial; Myocardial Ischemia; Myocarditis; novel strategies; Outcome; Pathologic; Pathway interactions; Patients; peripheral blood; Pharmacology; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases; Plasma; Play; Population; Process; Production; progenitor; Proteins; Public Health; receptor; receptor expression; Recovery; repaired; Research; response; Role; role model; Sampling; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Site; Source; Spleen; stable isotope; System; Testing; Therapeutic; Tissues; Tracer; United States National Institutes of Health; Variant"

Recent findings demonstrate that tumor-recruited adipose stem cells (ASCs) can promote tumor growth, especially in obese patients. Unlike normal counterparts, our preliminary data showed that factors secreted by PC cells induce phenotypic genotypic changes in patient-derived ASCs (pASCs) and subvert them to undergo neoplastic transformation. Microvesicles (MVs) (50-200 nm) from PC cells (C4-2B and PC-3), but not normal prostate epithelial cells (RWPE1), primed tumor-tropic pASCs to form neoplastic lesions with cytogenetic aberrations reminiscent of the molecular features of prostate tumors and mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). The oncogenic 'reprogramming' of pASCs was associated with the transfer of a number of oncogenic miRNAs (miR-125b, miR-130b, miR-155) and oncogenic mRNAs (H-Ras and K-Ras), which in turn down-regulated several key tumor suppressors (TP53, PDCD4 and Lats2) in pASCs. Our data deciphered previously uncharacterized roles for tumor-derived extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) in promoting tumor growth via the release and uptake of MVs by the recipient pASCs. Cancer patient's sera contain high levels of circulating MVs in comparison to normal subjects; thus it is possible to speculate the transfer of oncogenic exRNA cargo by the tumor-derived MVs enable neoplastic transformation of pASCs in cancer patients. Accordingly, targeting MVs biogenesis and release by tumor cells and/or uptake by pASCs, rather than individual exRNAs, would be more efficacious in abrogating the transfer and tumor development by multiple oncogenic exRNAs in pASCs. We therefore hypothesize that a high throughput screening (HTS) of clinically approved compounds will enable us to select lead agents that suppress the biogenesis and release of MVs from tumor cells and/or the uptake of MVs by pASCs. We will corroborate our hypothesis by utilizing milestone-driven experiments in cell culture models and by proof-of-concept pre-clinical studies in animal models of PC. The UH2 (phase-I) will identify compounds that potently abrogate the biogenesis, release and/or uptake of MVs in vitro and in vivo. The UH3 (phase-II) will further validate the in vivo anti-tumor
efficacy of these pharmacological leads and will support more rigorous milestone-driven pre-clinical studies in animal models. The following specific aims, to be executes through two phases, corroborate our hypothesis: Phase-I (UH2) (1) Demonstrate if circulating MVs procured from CRPC patients harbor oncogenic exRNAs and induce neoplastic transformation of pASCs. (2) Optimize HTS assays to identify lead compounds which inhibit the release of MVs by tumor cells, or their uptake by recipient pASCs, or reduce their oncogenic miRNA/RNA load. (3) Establish if lead compounds inhibit tumor cell release and/or uptake of MVs by pASCs in vivo. Phase II (UH3) (1) Examine the efficacy of lead compounds in inhibiting ASC-derived tumor development in vivo. (2) Clinical applicability of the lead compounds from the NCATS library. Although MVs have been implicated in cancer progression (neovacularization), their role in neoplastic transformation of stem cells in cancer patients has not been investigated. Our demonstration of tumor cell derived MVs in transfer of extracellular onco-RNAs and transformation of patient procured ASCs is novel and lend credence to their potential role in outgrowth and/or progression of metastatic disease in cancer patients. Accordingly, the proposed work is innovative, because it capitalizes not only in underpinning discovery of new functional roles for MV-mediated onco-miRs and onco-mRNAs, but also in identifying new lead therapeutic compounds to circumvent PC progression. By establishing preventive and/or therapeutic intervention strategies, the outcome of the proposed studies is expected to exert a positive impact on the clinical management of advanced PC.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Unraveling the underlying mechanisms of tumor growth and metastasis is critical to developing curative strategies against castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Our in vitro and in vivo preliminary data (Figs 1- 6) provide ccompelling evidence that tumor-derived MVs is a major underlying molecular culprit in neoplastic transformation of patient-derived adipose stem cells (pASCs). Specifically, the transfer of oncogenic exRNAs (miRNAs/mRNAs) by tumor cell-derived MVs to pASCs cause formation of prostate tumors that are marked with genetic instability, neovasculature and mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). Our data deciphered previously uncharacterized roles for tumor-derived extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) in promoting tumor growth via the release and uptake of MVs by the recipient pASCs. Cancer patient's sera contain high levels of circulating MVs in comparison to normal subjects; thus it is possible to speculate the transfer of oncogenic exRNA cargo by the tumor-derived MVs enable neoplastic transformation of pASCs in cancer patients. Accordingly, targeting MVs biogenesis and release by tumor cells and/or uptake by pASCs, rather than individual exRNAs, would be more efficacious in abrogating the transfer and tumor development by multiple oncogenic exRNAs in pASCs. We therefore hypothesize that a high throughput screening (HTS) of clinically approved compounds will enable us to select lead agents that suppress the biogenesis and release of MVs from tumor cells and/or the uptake of MVs by pASCs. Over the past decade, High Throughput Screening (HTS) emerged as a way to screen a large number of compound libraries against multiple targets while simultaneously reducing development and operating costs. Indeed, several scientific advances have driven the need for improved drug discovery screening technology through HTS. HTS can be considered the process in which batches of compounds are tested for binding or biological activity against target molecules. Today, many pharmaceutical companies are screening 100,000- 300,000 or more compounds per screen to produce approximately 100-300 hits. The invention of automated plate-handling robotics and robust miniaturized assays, primarily through 384-well and higher density plates, has made HTS a reality. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to exploit this technology to identify ""quality leads"" with the desirable drug like properties tat would effectively inhibit release of MVs, and consequently oncogenic exRNAs, by tumor cells and/or uptake by pASCs. The MV targeting drugs are expected to reduce or circumvent tumor burden and progression in cancer patients. During phase I (UH2) of the proposed research, the cell-, and animal based initial HTS screenings are expected to identify hits (10-20) that inhibit biogenesis/secretion of MVs by prostate tumor cells and/or uptake of MVs by the recipient cells (pASCs). During Phase 2 (UH3) further validation studies will be conducted to examine and validate if inhibition of MVs release and/or uptake by the lead compounds is associated with tumor formation by pASCs in vivo. Additionally, in phase 2 of the project, safety, tolerability, phamacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the lead compounds will be assessed for clinical utility in humans.","Adipose tissue; Animal Model; Animals; base; Binding; Biogenesis; Biological; Biological Assay; Cancer Patient; castration resistant prostate cancer; CD81 gene; Cell Culture Techniques; cell growth; Cell Line; Cells; Chimeric Proteins; Chromosome abnormality; Clinical; clinical application; Clinical Management; Collection; cost; Coupled; Data; density; Detection; Development; Disease; Dose; Down-Regulation; drug discovery; Drug Kinetics; Drug Targeting; Epithelial Cells; epithelial to mesenchymal transition; experimental study; extracellular; Flow Cytometry; Fluorescence Microscopy; Frequencies; Gene Targeting; Genetic; Genetic Transcription; Genotype; Goals; high throughput screening; HRAS gene; Human; Immunocompromised Host; Implant; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; Individual; innovation; Intervention; invention; Investigation; KRAS2 gene; Label; Lead; Lesion; Libraries; Measures; Mediating; Messenger RNA; MicroRNAs; microvesicles; migration; mimicry; miniaturize; Modeling; Molecular; Monitor; Mus; Neoplasm Metastasis; neoplastic; neoplastic cell; Neoplastic Cell Transformation; neovasculature; novel; NU/NU Mouse; Obesity; Oncogenic; Outcome; Patients; PC3 cell line; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacodynamics; Pharmacologic Substance; Pharmacology; Phase; Phenotype; preclinical study; Preventive Intervention; Process; Property; Prostate; prostate cancer cell; Prostatic Neoplasms; public health relevance; Recruitment Activity; Research; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA; Robotics; Role; Route; Safety; Scientific Advances and Accomplishments; screening; small molecule libraries; Stem cells; Surface; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Intervention; TP53 gene; Tracer; Translational Research; tumor; Tumor Burden; tumor growth; tumor progression; Tumor Suppressor Proteins; tumor xenograft; Tumor-Derived; tumorigenic; Tumorigenicity; United States National Institutes of Health; uptake; validation studies; Work"

"1R01HL137351-01","THE ROLE OF COMPLEX II IN HEART FAILURE","ABDELLATIF, MAHA","ABDELLATIF, MAHA","The mechanisms underlying cardiac myocyte demise and heart failure remain a central focus of much of the
research in the field. Not surprising, dysfunction and damage of the mitochondria are major causes of cell
death, as they are the main source of energy in the cell. For that same reason, they are also subject to several
self-preserving and quality control mechanisms during stress. One of the understudied aspects of this research
include the mechanisms via which mitochondria can promptly increase energy supply upon an increase in
demand, during health or disease, and the role of the reserve respiratory capacity (RRC) in this process, its
source, and mechanisms of regulation. In our recent report and preliminary data, we have identified multiple
factors and conditions that modulate the levels of the RRC, including growth factors, and the AMPK-Sirt3 axis.
We also reported that mitochondrial complex II (cII), composed of succinate dehydrogenase (Sdh) subunits
a,b,c,d, is the main source of the RRC in cardiac myocytes (Fig. 1). Notably, we found that during heart failure
cII activity and RRC are significantly reduced, which is associated with reduced expression of Sdh assembly
factor 1 (Sdhaf1; mutated in infantile mitochondrial disease). We could rescue this effect via expression of an
acetylation- and degradation-resistant, Sdhaf1 mutant. On the other hand, partial knockdown of this gene in
the heart in vivo results in abrogation of RRC, accelerates myocyte death, and cardiac dysfunction.
We hypothesize that: 1) The RRC is a product of cII assembly and activity, which is regulated by Sdhaf1.
Upstream regulators of this factor and RRC include sensors and regulators of cellular energy such as AMPK
and Sirt3. Regulation of Sdhaf1 is mediated through both long-term transcriptional changes and acute
posttranslational modifications. 2) The RRC supports myocyte survival during stress conditions, mainly via
increasing energy production during increased demand, and reducing the production of reactive oxygen
species through preventing the disassembly of cII, 3) During cardiac hypertrophy Sdhaf1 is downregulated,
which contributes to disassembly of cII, myocyte loss, and failure. Therefore, replenishing the heart with an
acetylation- and degradation-resistant Sdhaf1 will help improve myocyte health and survival during stress. The
specific aims are: 1) Study the mechanisms that contribute to the development and regulation of mitochondrial
reserve respiratory capacity, with a focus on the role of complex II and its regulation via Sdhaf1 and AMPK-
Sirt3. 2) Study the mechanisms via which the mitochondrial reserve respiratory capacity influences cell survival
and resistance to cell death, with a focus on the assembly/disassembly of complex II, and its contribution to
ATP and ROS production. 3) Determine if reconstituting Sdhaf1 and Sirt3 in the heart during hypertrophy could
restore assembly and activity of cII, and the reserve respiratory capacity, and their roles in enhancing myocyte
survival and slowing the progression of heart failure.","Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of mortality in industrialized nations. Therefore,
investigating the mitochondrial bioenergetics and the mechanisms that regulated it, including its role in
increasing the resistance of myocytes to the damaging effects of stress, will offer us the prospect to design
novel strategies that retard the progression of cardiac failure, which is the focus of this grant. The unique
aspect of this study is the focus on the mitochondrial respiratory complexes as a source of a respiratory
reserve capacity, which we propose is essential for cell survival during stress conditions.","Acetylation; Acute; Bioenergetics; Cardiac Myocytes; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cell Death; Cell Survival; Cells; Cessation of life; Complex; Data; design; Developed Countries; Development; Disease; Energy Supply; Energy-Generating Resources; Failure; Functional disorder; Genes; Genetic Transcription; Grant; Growth Factor; Health; Heart; Heart failure; Heart Hypertrophy; Hypertrophy; improved; in vivo; infancy; knock-down; Mediating; Mitochondria; Mitochondrial Diseases; mortality; Muscle Cells; mutant; Mutate; Myocardial dysfunction; novel strategies; Post-Translational Protein Processing; prevent; Process; Production; Quality Control; Reactive Oxygen Species; reconstitution; Regulation; Reporting; Research; Resistance; respiratory; Role; sensor; Source; Stress; Succinate Dehydrogenase"

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Renal transplantation has become the treatment of choice for patients with end-stage renal disease. However, acute renal allograft rejection (ARAR) remains a major complication after kidney transplantation and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Importantly, ARAR remains the strongest predictor of long-term renal allograft injury and survival. Currently known risk factors do not allow for an accurate
risk assessment of ARAR. Genetic variability in key immunoregulatory molecules likely contributes to the differential risk of ARAR in the transplant population and assessment of genetic variants through differences in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can provide valuable markers for ARAR risk assessment. In addition, we currently lack a non-invasive, cost-effective clinical test to diagnose ARAR. Therefore, in this proposal, we plan to 1) utilize our innovative genetic platform to identify immunogenetic biomarkers for ARAR risk assessment and 2) assess the role of peripheral cytokine profiling for the diagnosis of ARAR. The goals of this Mid-Career Investigator Award are to expand Dr. Reza Abdi's patient-oriented research program towards the development of better diagnostic and prognostic strategies for ARAR in renal transplant patients, further enhance Dr. Abdi's mentoring skills, and provide him with the resources and support to foster the development of trainees interested in patient-oriented research in transplantation. This research proposal is built upon the candidate's prior research identifying genetic biomarkers in transplantation and is strengthened by his multidisciplinary collaborations. These projects offer a unique opportunity for mentees to train in patient-oriented clinical and translational transplantation research that is at the intersection of immunology, genetics and transplantation. From this training vehicle, mentees will gain skills to carry out patient-oriented research in transplantation, learn to apply cutting-edge immunogenetic testing and gain hands-on experience in translational research examining the molecular and cellular mechanisms that lead to ARAR. The rich resources and infrastructure at Harvard Medical School and the Brigham and Women's Hospital Renal Division/Transplantation Research Center provide an outstanding scientific research environment to train the next generation of researchers in transplantation. These studies will not only help identify novel immunogenetic biomarkers for predicting ARAR and help in the creation of a clinical tool for diagnosing ARAR, but will also advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of ARAR and greatly assist in the development of innovative therapies in renal transplantation.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Acute renal allograft rejection (ARAR) is a major complication after renal transplantation and remains the strongest predictor of long-term renal allograft injury

 Every transplant organ experiences ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI). IRI evokes major intra-graft
inflammatory immune responses, which augments graft immunogenicity, increases the rate of allograft
rejection and markedly worsens solid organ transplantation outcomes. Reducing the deleterious effects of IRI-
induced inflammatory responses has even greater clinical implications given the usage of marginal grafts as a
common practice worldwide to address the shortage of organs. Nonetheless, the mechanisms by which IRI
links the innate and adaptive immunity arms remain poorly explored. Our previous studies have shown that
resident dendritic cells in the allografts (RDCA) play pivotal roles in linking innate and alloimmune responses.
Data from our laboratory obtained using various transgenic models have led to the novel observation that
increased production of IL-6 by RDCA exposed to oxidative stress leads to increased formation of CD4
alloreactive T cells in heart allografts and their respective draining lymph nodes (DLN). Intriguingly, the
expression of peripheral node addressin (PNAd) molecules was markedly upregulated in the DLN of the
respective ischemic organs. PNAd are adhesive molecules on the high endothelial venules of LN and play a
central role in T cell homing to the LN. Use of systemic anti-IL6 therapy markedly reduced inflammatory
responses in the ischemic allografts and prevented chronic rejection, which is the major obstacle to long-term
acceptance of organ transplants. When we further examined the mechanism of RDCA induction by IRI, we
found that IRI markedly increases autophagy in DC. Autophagy plays a key role in regulating the surface
expression of MHC molecules on DC and release of inflammatory cytokines by DC. Finally, we have devised
an innovative platform for the targeted delivery of immunoregulatory agents to organs and DLN to dampen the
deleterious effects of IRI. With these data, the primary goal of this project is to investigate the mechanisms by
which IRI enhances the immunogenicity of allografts and to identify novel protective strategies to minimize IRI,
with the ultimate goal of promoting long-term allograft acceptance. In AIM 1, we will examine the mechanisms
by which RDCA promotes IRI-induced alloimmunity. In AIM 2, we will examine the mechanism of suppression
of IRI-induced alloimmunity by anti-IL-6 therapy. In AIM 3, we will develop DLN and heart allograft targeted
delivery using nanocarriers of anti-IL6 to reduce IRI-induced alloimmunity without systemic
immunosuppression.","Project Narrative

Furthermore, the frequent failure in the clinial setting of cancer drugs with demonstrable activity in xenograft models makes the testing of drug candidates in autochthonous animal models imperative. The overarching goal of this research program is to develop the oncogenic serine-threonine kinase PIM1 kinase as a therapeutic target in prostate cancer. PIM1 is coexpressed with c-MYC and dramatically enhances c-MYC-driven prostate tumorigenesis in a kinase-dependent manner. Notably, PIM1 is induced in tumors by hypoxia and by treatment with docetaxel, a common but largely ineffective option for patients with advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer. PIM1 induction by hypoxia and docetaxel promotes prostate cancer cell survival and therapeutic resistance. Therefore PIM1 may represent a valuable therapeutic target in prostate cancer. To test this notion, we have developed new autochthonous mouse models of prostate cancer for testing the efficacy of novel PIM1 kinase inhibitors in treating prostate cancer and reversing therapeutic resistance. We have also identified novel candidate PIM1-interacting proteins in prostate epithelial cells. Among the proteins identified are a MYC transcriptional cofactor and a prostate stem cell marker/regulator. We hypothesize that PIM1 promotes prostate tumorigenesis by phosphorylating key substrates involved in regulating MYC transcriptional acivity and stem cell function and that targeting PIM1 kinase activity is an effective strategy to treat MYC/PIM1- expressing prostate cancer. We will address these hypotheses via three aims. In the first aim, we will elucidate the mechanistic basis for cooperativity between MYC and PIM1 in prostate cancer. In the second aim, we will investigate the role of PIM1 in regulating stem cell renewal. In the third aim, we will test the efficacy of novel PIM1 kinase inhibitors in treating prostate cancer and reversing therapeutic resistance in vivo.

A major clinical problem in the management of prostate cancer is the difficulty associated with treating aggressive 
cancers, especially those that are highly castration resistant. The androgen signaling pathway remains a key 
therapeutic target for advanced prostate cancer but resistance to agents targeting this pathway is common, 
highlighting the need to develop novel therapeutic approaches. Mouse prostate cancer modeling has elucidated 
molecular pathways of aggressive, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) which include loss of the tumor 
suppressors PTEN and TP53 and overexpression of the MYC oncogene. Using these spontaneous mouse 
models of prostate cancer we have identified Ephrin receptor EphB4 as a potential therapeutic target. EPHB4 is 
a receptor tyrosine kinase that with its ligand ephrin B2, are not expressed in normal prostate gland, but are 
expressed in a majority of human prostate cancers. EPHB4 is induced by multiple pathways important for CRPC 
development, including loss of PTEN and TP53 as well as activation of the PI3K pathway downstream of EGFR 
and IGF1R. In turn, EPHB4 activation engages multiple signaling pathways, including the PI3 kinase/AKT and 
MAPK pathways known to modulate the androgen receptor and drive CRPC development. To test the 
significance of EphB4, we generated conditional EphB4 knockout mouse. We found that genetic deletion of 
EphB4 or its inhibition using a soluble antagonist (sEPHB4) profoundly inhibited prostate tumorigenesis driven 
by loss of Pten and led to the regression of established tumors in transgenic mice. This was associated with 
inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling and apoptosis. Notably, sEpBh4 antagonist and EphB4 knockdown led to 
markedly lower levels of androgen receptor (AR) protein. These functional genetic data lead us to hypothesize 
that EPHB4 is a novel pharmacologic target with high therapeutic potential in prostate cancer, including CRPC. 
We will explore this hypothesis by targeting EphB4 in genetically complex mouse models (loss of Pten, Tp53 
and Myc over-expression) and human xenograft models of prostate cancer and CRPC, singly or in combination 
with AR-targeted therapy (including enzalutamide, abiraterone). We will examine human prostate tumor samples 
including metastases and CRPCs for the expression of EphB4, EphrinB2, and downstream markers. A soluble 
decoy EPHB4 receptor – human serum albumin fusion protein (sEPHB4HSA) antagonist is in early human trials 
in other tumors, and has been found to be remarkably safe in Phase I study. We will therefore implement a 
feasibility clinical trial of sEPHB4HSA aimed at determining the therapeutic efficacy of targeting EPHB4 in men 
with CRPC. Successful completion of the preclinical and early clinical studies we propose in this application 
could lead to a rapid translation of soluble EPHB4 antagonist as a treatment for advanced prostate cancer.","PROJECT 3: PROJECT NARRATIVE 
EphB4 receptor tyrosine kinase is upregulated in prostate cancer including CRPC and promotes tumor cell 
survival and progression by engaging multiple downstream signaling pathways. Treatment of Pten knockout 
mouse model of prostate cancer and human CRPC xenograft-bearing mice with soluble EphB4 inhibitor causes

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of the proposed Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Education Program is to increase research capacity and quality in global health research and research training in China and other Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs). This will be achieved through the creation of a model educational program in research informatics and communication science at Guangxi Medical University (GMU) for their biomedical and health researchers including faculty and graduate student trainees. To ensure that the model ICT education program is appropriate for and adaptable to non-GMU institutions, five other Chinese medical universities will participate actively in the development of the model ICT education program and will adapt and implement it to their settings upon completion of this 3 year project. The development, use and evaluation of the model program will be performed at GMU's Center for Medical Information Technology (CMIT) which facilitates educational innovation using information and communication technologies. The Joint PIs for the project are two Boston University (BU) faculty: Robert Friedman, MD, a senior informatician who has worked internationally, including China, and Abu Abdullah, MD, PhD, a global health researcher in behavioral health who was trained in China and does most of his research in that country. The proposed training program builds on prior research capacity building in China by the two PIs, including NIH FIC support for dementia epidemiologic research at GMU (PI: Abdullah) and NIH FIRCA that established behavioral informatics research laboratories at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and the Shenzhen Chronic Disease Hospital in China (PI: Friedman). The two specific aims are to: 1) expand previous Fogarty-funded research capacity- building programs in China and extend them to other LMICs, and 2) build upon existing ICT education at BU in informatics and Emerson College (Boston) in health communications science. The specific tasks to be performed during the 3 year project at GMU are 1) a formal needs assessment based on methods used by Dr. Friedman in developing an informatics course at BU for national dissemination, 2) development of the curriculum and how it will be delivered at GMU based on the results of the needs assessment study, 3) pilot testing, implementation and operation of the ICT education program at GMU; 4) continuous quality improvement (CQI) and formal evaluation of the ICT program. An Oversight Group of faculty and students at GMU and the five non-GMU universities that will implement the ICT program, will form a  learning community  to oversee ICT program development and its adaptation to non-GMU settings.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ICT is essential in modern day biomedical and health research for the following reasons: 1) projects entail the analysis and interpretation of very larg complex datasets for which informatics methods are essential, and 2) use of ICT in health interventions is becoming commonplace.

"5F31CA180740-05","THE ROLE OF SRC KINASE IN ESTROGEN RECEPTOR-POSITIVE BREAST CANCER PROLIFERATION","ABDULLAH, CHRISTOPHER","ABDULLAH, CHRISTOPHER","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Estrogen (E2) is known to induce proliferation in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer cells. Additionally, ER+ breast cancers, unlike the majority of cancers, typically express wild-type tumor suppressor p53 and often express hyperactive Src kinase. The pathways involving E2-stimulated cell cycle progression in ER+ breast cancer cells remains unknown. Previous studies in growth factor-stimulated fibroblasts has shown that mitogenesis requires the Src family kinases (SFKs) to inhibit p53 prior to progressing through the cell cycle. This SFK cell cycle block can be rescued by exogenous expression of the oncogene, Myc. My preliminary data suggests a similar pathway functioning in the ER+ breast cancer cell line MCF7 after E2 stimulation. E2-stimulated mitogenesis in MCF7 cells requires SFK activity but not in MCF7 cells lacking p53. Additionally, E2 stimulates expression of myc mRNA dependent on SFK activity. This increase in myc mRNA expression appears to be due to mRNA stability. This proposal attempts to identify the molecular mechanism of Src inhibition of p53, likely through regulation of Hdm2 and Hdmx, inhibitors of p53. The proposal also aims to test how Src regulates myc mRNA stability through p53 as well as IMP1, an RNA-binding protein which is known to stabilize myc mRNA. Overall, this proposal aims to test my hypothesis that Src kinase regulates cell cycle progression in ER+ breast cancer by inhibiting p53 function and stabilizing Myc expression.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  ER-positive breast cancers, which make up approximately 70% of breast cancers, have typically responded well to anti-estrogen treatment, however nearly half of this majority of breast cancer either are primarily resistant or develop resistance o this therapy. Characterization of the critical pathway that promotes cell growth in ER-positive breast cancer can provide critical knowledge for developing therapy. This proposal will provide insight into potential new therapeutic targets for ER-positive breast cancer as well as novel criteria to stratify patients for effective treatments.","Affect; Apoptosis; base; Binding Proteins; Biological Assay; Breast Cancer Cell; Breast Cancer cell line; Cell Cycle; Cell Cycle Progression; cell growth; Cell Line; Cells; Complex; Critical Pathways; Data; Dominant-Negative Mutation; effective therapy; Estrogen Antagonists; Estrogen receptor positive; Estrogens; experimental study; Fibroblasts; Genetic Transcription; Genomics; Growth; Growth Factor; Hormonal; Hormone Receptor; Hyperactive behavior; inhibitor/antagonist; insight; kinase inhibitor; Knowledge; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant Neoplasms; MCF7 cell; Messenger RNA; Molecular; mRNA Expression; mRNA Stability; Mutation; new therapeutic target; non-genomic; novel; Oncogenes; Oncogenic; overexpression; Pathway interactions; patient stratification; Peptides; Play; progesterone receptor positive; Protein p53; Protein Tyrosine Kinase; public health relevance; Regulation; Resistance; Resistance development; response; RNA Interference; RNA-Binding Proteins; Role; S Phase; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Solid Neoplasm; src-Family Kinases; Stable Disease; Stimulation of Cell Proliferation; Stimulus; Testing; therapeutic target; therapy development; TP53 gene; Transcript; transcription factor; Transcriptional Activation; triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma; tumor; tumor growth; Tumor Subtype; Tumor Suppressor Proteins"
"1I01RX002260-01A1","TREATING GWI IMMUNE AND METABOLIC DISTURBANCES BY TARGETING LIPID METABOLISM","ABDULLAH, LAILA","ABDULLAH, LAILA","Abstract:
 Veterans from the 1990-1991 Persian Gulf War (GW) are af<U+FB02>icted with Gulf War Illness (GWI) which is
characterized by a constellation of unexplainable symptoms that include chronic pain, memory impairment and
fatigue. Consequently, veterans with GWI have limited function and activities of daily, resulting in loss of
productive years. Research studies provide compelling evidence that GWI may have been caused by
exposure to chemicals, such as an anti-nerve agent pyridostigmine bromide (PB) and different types of
pesticides (GW agents). In particular, the types of pesticides to which GW veterans were exposed are also
those implicated in chronic neurodegenerative conditions associated with aging, such as Alzheimer' disease
(AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). A concern also raised by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in their recent
reports. Imaging studies show that the brain structures involved in processing and storing memory and brain
pathways involved in controlling pain and fatigue are altered in GW veterans with GWI. Many of these brain
structures (i.e. the hippocampus) are also affected in neurodegenerative illness. Over the last two decades,
important clinical discoveries have been made which show that immune/in<U+FB02>ammatory and metabolic
disturbances are contributors to the pathology of GWI.
 The Roskamp Institute (RI) scientists have been at the forefront of research aimed at identifying therapies
for treating the central nervous system (CNS) symptoms associated with GWI. Previously, RI scientists
developed a novel mouse model of GWI using GW agents (pyridostigmine bromide [PB] and pesticides) which
exhibits neurobehavioral de<U+FB01>cits that are similar to symptoms reported in veterans with GWI. At chronic post-
exposure time-points, GW agent exposed mice had astroglia and microglia activation in the brain, suggesting a
presence of neuroin<U+FB02>ammation. Biochemical investigations show that GW agent exposed mice had abnormal
phospholipid (PL) pro<U+FB01>les for species that contained ether linkages and omega-3 and omega-6
polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). In this well-characterized GWI mouse model, there were also dramatic
decreases in cardiolipins (CL) and acylcarnitines, lipids that are speci<U+FB01>c to mitochondrial function. We also
observed changes in omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA, mitochondrial CL and acylcarnitines and very long-chain
fatty acid (VLCFA) and branched chain fatty acid (BCFA) that are speci<U+FB01>c to peroxisomal function in the blood
samples from veterans with GWI compared to GW era controls. Since these lipids are speci<U+FB01>c to immune/
in<U+FB02>ammation and mitochondrial and peroxisomal functions, our <U+FB01>ndings suggest their involvement in GWI
pathogenesis. Many of these lipids are those which contribute to oxidative stress and in<U+FB02>ammation associated
with neurodegenerative illnesses.
 We therefore hypothesized that targeting omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA and mitochondrial and peroxisomal
lipid metabolism may be useful in developing therapies which target in<U+FB02>ammation and metabolic disturbances
associated with GWI. Targeting these lipids may also prevent GW veterans from developing
neurodegeneration later in life. In this proposal, we will test novel natural compounds which target the above
mentioned lipids in order to determine if these compounds can ameliorate cognitive dysfunction and astroglia
and microglia activation in the brains of GW agent exposed mice. These studies will facilitate development of
innovative intervention strategies which can be rapidly translated into clinical use for maximizing their bene<U+FB01>t in
treating ill GW veterans who have been suffering from this condition for 25 years.","About 25% of the 700,000 veterans from the 1990-1991 Gulf War (GW) are living with Gulf War Illness
(GWI) for over two decades. Chemicals to which GW veterans were exposed puts them at a higher risk of
developing neurodegenerative diseases later in life. Brain imaging studies conducted on veterans with GWI
compared to controls point to changes in the brain structures and networks that are involved in cognitive
function. These studies provide compelling evidence that targeting the brain pathology in GWI will be
bene<U+FB01>cial in treating GWI. Studies described in this proposal will identify therapies that target lipids
associated with immune/in<U+FB02>ammation and mitochondrial and peroxisomal disruptions observed in GWI.
Therapeutic targeting of these lipids may have the potential for improving the underlying brain pathology of
GWI which can help improve the health of ill GW veterans so that they can integrate into community and
perform normal activities of daily living.","Activities of Daily Living; acylcarnitine; Affect; age related; age related neurodegeneration; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Anti-inflammatory; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Arachidonic Acids; associated symptom; Astrocytes; Biochemical; Blood; Blood specimen; Brain; Brain imaging; Brain Pathology; brain pathway; branched chain fatty acid; Bromides; Cardiolipins; Chemical Exposure; Chemicals; Chronic; chronic pain; Clinic; Clinical; clinical practice; cognitive function; common symptom; Communities; Coupled; Data; Defect; Development; Docosahexaenoic Acids; effective therapy; Electron Transport; Ethers; Exhibits; Exposure to; Fatigue; Generations; Gulf War; Health; high risk; Hippocampus (Brain); imaging study; Immune; Impaired cognition; improved; in vivo; Inflammation; Inflammation Mediators; Inflammatory; innovation; Institute of Medicine (U.S.); Institutes; Intervention; Investigation; Life; lipid metabolism; Lipids; long chain fatty acid; Memory; Memory impairment; Metabolic; Metabolism; Microglia; Mitochondria; mouse model; Mus; nerve agent; Nerve Degeneration; Neuraxis; neurobehavioral; Neurodegenerative Disorders; neuroinflammation; novel; Nuclear Receptors; oleoylethanolamide; Omega-3 Fatty Acids; oxidation; Oxidative Stress; Pain; Parkinson Disease; Pathogenesis; Pathogenicity; Pathology; peroxisome; Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors; Persian Gulf; persistent symptom; Pesticides; Phospholipids; Poisons; Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids; pre-clinical; prevent; Process; programs; Proteomics; pyridostigmine; Quality of life; Regimen; Rehabilitation therapy; Reporting; Research; research study; Risk; Scientist; Series; Stable Isotope Labeling; Structure; Supplementation; Symptoms; targeted treatment; Testing; Therapeutic Intervention; therapeutic target; therapy development; Time; Translating; Translations; United States Food and Drug Administration; Very Long Chain Fatty Acid; Veterans; Work"

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) affects more than 125,000 patients in the US annually, and carries significant morbidity and mortality rates approaching 40%. Despite increased understanding of the initiating events leading to ARDS, therapies directed at these mechanisms have failed to improve the lives of patients with this devastating disease. Unintended bystander lung tissue injury and dysfunction from dysregulated acute inflammation are the hallmarks of ARDS. In health, acute inflammatory responses are terminated by specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) that restrain the inflammatory response and signal for resolution. A new family of docosahexaenoic acid-derived SPMs from macrophages was recently uncovered in murine peritonitis and coined maresins (i.e., macrophage mediators in resolving inflammation). In work in progress, we have identified a new intra-vascular biosynthetic pathway for maresin 1 (MaR1) early after acute lung injury (ALI) that is pivotal to controlling lung inflammation and protecting lung function. Of note, at a later time point after ALI, MaR1 is produced via a different biosynthetic route that involves lung tissue
macrophages. We hypothesize that MaR1 activates resolution pathways that are critical in ARDS. To investigate this hypothesis, we have proposed the following specific aims: 1) to determine restoration of lung function by MaR1 after ALI using established and innovative methods; 2) to determine the role of MaR1 on monocyte recruitment for resolution of acute lung injury; 3) to examine the role of MaR1 in macrophage programming, and the macrophage subsets that serve as the cellular source of MaR1 during resolution of acute lung inflammation. We will use a clinically relevant murine model of ARDS for discovery and mechanistic experiments, and validate these findings in human samples from a Registry of Critical Illness. Under the guidance of his mentor Dr. Bruce D. Levy, the principal investigator has developed a five-year training program that includes tailored didactic activities, and mechanisms to ensure continued mentoring and supervision, to develop the skills necessary to become a successful physician-scientist in the field of pulmonary and critical care medicine. The candidate's training will be overseen by an advisory committee with expertise related to key areas of this proposal including ALI, resolution of inflammation, monocyte/macrophage biology, and functional imaging. The proposed career development plan will establish scientific foundations and provide the additional training necessary to achieve the principal investigator's ultimate goal of becoming an independent investigator studying the biologic basis for resolution of ARDS.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE

"5R01HL118462-05","P90RSK-ERK5 MODULE, EFFEROCYTOSIS, AND VULNERABLE PLAQUE FORMATION","ABE, JUN-ICHI","ABE, JUN-ICHI","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A necrotic core formed in an advanced atherosclerosis (AS) lesion is a collection of necrotic macrophages (MF) surrounded by inflammatory cells, which contributes to inflammation, plaque disruption, and thrombosis, and eventually develops into a vulnerable plaque. Ordinarily, rapid phagocytic clearance (efferocytosis) by macrophages prevents necrotic core formation, but increasing evidence indicates that efferocytosis is defective in advanced lesions. Although efferocytosis can be up-regulated by HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors (statins)1-3, the comprehensive regulatory mechanism for efferocytosis remains unclear. In the study, we show that statins/ACs treatment activates ERK5 kinase in MF and accelerates efferocytosis via secretion of opsonins and M2 MF polarization, whereas these responses are inhibited in MF derived from macrophage specific ERK5 knock-out (ERK5- MKO) mice. Indeed, ERK5-MKO/LDLR-/- mice showed increased necrotic core and AS formation. On the other hand, p90RSK activated by angiotensin II (AngII) inhibited the ERK5 role in MF functions by inhibiting ERK5 transcriptional activity via ERK5 S496 phosphorylation. In addition, MF-specific wild type-p90RSK transgenic (WT-p90RSK-MTg) crossing to LDLR-/- mice exhibited accelerated formation of necrotic core and AC formation. It suggests that the interplay between p90RSK and ERK5 are critical for the regulation of various MF functions. We therefore hypothesize that statin/ACs-mediated ERK5 kinase activation is a key step in efferocytosis, which inhibits AS and necrotic core formation, while p90RSK activation under AngII, or in advanced atherosclerotic lesions, inhibits efferocytosis via inhibiting ERK5. We will design experiments to address this hypothesis using an in vivo and in vitro approach. The three specific aims of this proposal are 1) We will test the hypothesis that the balance between p90RSK and ERK5 activation under AngII, statins, or CSF-1 stimulation differentially regulates MF functions such as proliferation, apoptosis, M1/M2 phenotypes, and efferocytosis, 2) We will investigate our hypothesis that p90RSK activation induced by AngII or in advanced plaques inhibits ERK5 transcriptional activity and efferocytosis, which promotes the formation of AS plaques and necrotic cores, and 3) We will test the hypothesis that ERK5 activation or inhibition of p90RSK increases efferocytosis and inhibits AS and necrotic core formation via up-regulation of Mfge8. The significance of our study is in providing a mechanistic understanding of the clinically well-described cardiac risk of acute athero-thrombotic vascular disease in advanced atherosclerotic lesions. Also, understanding the role and molecular mechanisms of ERK5- mediated efferocytosis and inhibition of the necrotic core and AS formation should provide insight into the cause of acute atherothrombotic vascular diseases and possibly reveal novel therapeutic targets.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The key role of efferocytosis in atherosclerosis and the stability of vulnerable plaques have become increasingly evident. We anticipate that specific macrophage ERK5 downregulation and subsequent reduced expression of ERK5 targeted molecules including efferocytosis-related genes make macrophages atheroprone and form a vulnerable plaque accumulating apoptotic debris and necrotic core. Mechanistically, we have found that p90RSK regulates the ERK5 effects on the efferocytosis process as a negative regulator. Therefore, the activation of ERK5 and inhibition of p90RSK activity could emerge as novel therapeutic targets to tackle the highly relevant problem of managing vulnerable plaques from rupture.","Acute; Address; Angiotensin II; Apoptosis; Apoptotic; Arterial Fatty Streak; Atherosclerosis; base; Biology; Blood Vessels; Cardiac; cell type; Cells; Clinical; Collection; Data; design; Dominant-Negative Mutation; Down-Regulation; Equilibrium; Event; Exhibits; experimental study; Gene Expression; Genes; Genetic Transcription; In Vitro; in vivo; Inflammation; Inflammatory; inhibitor/antagonist; insight; Knock-out; Knockout Mice; Lesion; Link; macrophage; Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor; MAPK7 gene; Mediating; Molecular; Mus; mutant; Myeloid Cells; Necrosis; new therapeutic target; novel; Opsonin; Oxidoreductase; Phagocytes; Phagocytosis; Phenotype; Phosphorylation; Phosphorylation Site; prevent; Process; public health relevance; Regulation; response; Risk; Role; Rupture; Scheme; Testing; Thrombosis; Time; Transactivation; Transgenic Mice; Transgenic Organisms; Up-Regulation; Vascular Diseases"

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction and vasculopathy play a key role in pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (AS). In addition to EC inflammation, senescence (Sen) may play a role in EC dysfunction. Telomere (TL) shortening and dysfunction provokes EC Sen, which is associated with focalized plaque formation. Although it is well known that disturbed flow (d-flow) increases both EC inflammation and Sen, the exact mechanisms by which d-flow uniquely induces these two different EC pathologies and subsequent AS are poorly understood. To answer the question of how d-flow leads to EC inflammation and Sen simultaneously, we developed in vivo and in vitro models for studying signaling induced by d-flow and found unique roles for p90RSK kinase and telomeric repeat-binding factor 2 (TRF2)-interacting protein (TERF2IP) and TRF2 complex in this mechanism. The TERF2IP-TRF2 complex is known to be involved in regulation of double strand break (DSB) repair of DNA at TLs as a component of the shelterin complex and of NF-<U+03BA>B signaling outside in the cytosol. In our preliminary studies, we found that d-flow induced p90RSK activation and up-regulated TERF2IP S205 phosphorylation and K240 SUMOylation in ECs. These TERF2IP posttranslational modifications were mediated by p90RSK activation, and overexpression of a kinase-dead mutant of p90RSK (KD-p90RSK), a TERF2IP S205A phosphorylation mutant, or a TERF2IP K240R SUMOylation mutant inhibited d-flow-induced Sen and DNA damage in ECs. Our central hypothesis is that d-flow-induced EC p90RSK activation, which increases TERF2IP phosphorylation and SUMOylation, elicits TL dysfunction by modifying the function of the TERF2IP-TRF2 complex, leading to EC dysfunction and ultimately to AS. We propose the following 3 aims to identify the mechanisms of TERF2IP-dependent EC dysfunction. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that TERF2IP phosphorylation causes nuclear export of the TERF2IP-TRF2 complex and subsequent TERF2IP SUMOylation reduces the TL protection activity of the complex. Aim 2 will investigate whether TERF2IP phosphorylation is crucial for up-regulating EC inflammation. In Aim 3, we will determine the role of the p90RSK-TERF2IP module in regulating EC function and AS plaque formation in vivo. Although the possible involvement of EC Sen in AS has been suggested, to our knowledge there has been no study on the role of shelterin complex in AS formation. The new knowledge on the pathways activated by d-flow that alter EC TL function will aid development of new therapeutic strategies for AS, especially by inhibiting p90RSK-mediated TERF2IP post- translational modifications.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The involvement of inflammation and senescence in endothelial cell dysfunction and subsequent atherosclerosis (AS) has been suggested. Our proposal focuses on mechanisms by which disturbed flow up- regulates endothelial inflammation, accelerates the vascular aging process, and subsequently causes AS. Our proposed studies will provide insights into mechanisms by which disturbed flow promotes vascular aging and vascular dysfunction and facilitate development of new therapeutic approaches for AS.","Aging; Aging-Related Process; Arterial Fatty Streak; Atherosclerosis; Attenuated; Blood Vessels; Cell Aging; Cell physiology; Complex; Cytosol; Development; DNA Damage; DNA Repair; Double Strand Break Repair; Embryo; Endothelial Cells; endothelial dysfunction; Functional disorder; Goals; in vitro Model; in vivo; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Response; insight; Knock-out; Knockout Mice; Knowledge; Link; Mediating; Mus; mutant; Mutation; novel therapeutic intervention; Nuclear; Nuclear Export; overexpression; Pathogenesis; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Phosphorylation; Phosphorylation Site; Phosphotransferases; Play; Post-Translational Protein Processing; prevent; protective effect; Proteins; public health relevance; Regulation; response; Role; Scheme; senescence; Signal Transduction; Study models; telomere; Telomere Shortening; TERF2 gene; Testing; Vascular Diseases"

Instead of being largely confined to the analysis of common SNPs shared across many populations and amenable to microarray genotyping, genome-wide studies can now examine a wider range of genetic variants - including more diverse types of variation (such as insertion-deletion polymorphisms), variants specific to particular samples or populations, and rare and low frequency variants. Here, we request continued support for our genetic analysis of aging related traits - with a focus on cardiovascular risk factors - in the isolated population from the island of Sardinia, Italy. Over the next several years, we will use next-generation sequencing technology and high-throughput genotyping to study the relationship between rare genetic variation and key cardiovascular risk factors in a family sample containing ~6,000 individuals (and >30,000 close relative pairs) recruited in the Lanusei valley. As part of our planned experiments, we will evaluate problems related to the selection of samples for sequencing, the design of sequencing experiments and protocols, the analysis and curation of the resulting sequence data, and - finally - association analyses that connect the resulting variants to relevant biomedical traits. Individuals being studies are part of a longitudial study of aging and have been characterized for cardiovascular traits and outcomes, including multiple measurements of key traits such as blood lipid levels and blood pressure. We have previously studied this sample to identify common genetic variants that are associated with these cardiovascular traits and that also contribute to the risk of heart disease and obesity. Our proposed experimental plan presents a unique opportunity to evaluate the role of rare variation in this unique sample. We expect that these studies will result in experimental strategies and analysis tools that will be readily deployable by many laboratories to study the genomes of many other individuals and further our understanding of the genetics and biology of many different traits and conditions.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the past several years, genome-wide association studies have furthered our understanding of the molecular basis of several traits related to human health and disease. The success of these studies resulted, in large part, from their ability to explore the genome in a comprehensive manner, systematically assessing the impact of common variation on the trait of interest. Here we propose to use a well characterized family sample together with high-throughput sequencing technologies to extend these systematic whole genome assessments to rare variation. Our planned effort complements detailed efforts to characterize common and intermediate frequency genetic variants in the same sample. Our results should expand the understanding of the genetics of cardiovascular traits and also result in strategies that can be widely deployed to study many human traits.","Aging; analytical method; Biology; Blood; blood lipid; Blood Pressure; cardiovascular disorder risk; cardiovascular risk factor; Cardiovascular system; Chromosome Mapping; Code; Complement; Complex; Data; Data Analyses; deep sequencing; design; Development; Disease; Evaluation; experimental study; Face; Family; Founder Generation; Frequencies; Generations; Genetic; genetic analysis; genetic pedigree; Genetic Polymorphism; Genetic Population Study; Genetic study; genetic variant; Genetic Variation; Genome; genome wide association study; genome-wide analysis; Genotype; Haplotypes; Health; heart disease risk; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Human; Human Genetics; Imagery; Individual; insertion/deletion mutation; insight; interest; Island; Italy; Laboratories; Measurement; Meta-Analysis; Methods; Modeling; modifiable risk; Molecular; next generation sequencing; Obesity; Outcome; Population; Protocols documentation; public health relevance; rare variant; Recruitment Activity; Research; Research Design; Role; Sampling; Sampling Studies; Sardinia; Sequence Analysis; Site; SNP genotyping; success; targeted sequencing; Technology; Testing; tool; trait; Untranslated RNA; Variant; whole genome"

Reactivation of latent human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in 
transplant recipients, despite the use of antiviral drugs. Therefore, new approaches are required to reduce the 
complications from this pathogen. Due to the species specificity of HCMV, we have developed a clinically 
relevant transplant model using the highly related murine CMV (MCMV) as a model to study CMV latency and 
reactivation in the context of organ transplantation. In this model, MCMV latently infected kidneys are 
transplanted into B6 mice, inducing transcriptional reactivation of Immediate Early (IE) genes. Addition of a 
clinically relevant immunosuppression (IE) regimen results in reactivation of latent virus in the donor kidney, 
which disseminates into other organs of the recipient. Our preliminary data shows that IL-1/IL-18, IL-6/CD40, 
and TNF signaling are associated with IE gene expression following transplantation, presenting candidate 
pathways that can be targeted for therapeutic intervention. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the 
inflammatory response elicited by the transplanted kidney results a signaling cascade that stimulates 
epigenetic reprogramming of latent viral genomes, transcriptional reactivation of IE genes, and in 
immunosuppressed recipients, re-entry of latent virus into the lytic replication program. To test this hypothesis, 
in Aim 1 we will investigate the requirement for candidate factors identified in our preliminary studies, and their 
downstream signaling intermediates, in inducing reactivation. We have also shown that transplant-induced 
reactivation of IE expression is associated with epigenetic reprogramming. Previous studies by our 
collaborator, Dr. Thomas Kristie, have identified epigenetic inhibitors that suppress reactivation of latent herpes 
simplex virus. In Aim 2 we will investigate these promising therapeutic interventions for their ability to prevent 
reactivation of latent MCMV in our model. In Aim 3 we will investigate a new in vitro model of differentiation- 
induced reactivation of bone-marrow derived murine hematopoietic progenitor cells from latently infected mice. 
This complementary in vitro model will be exceptionally useful for defining molecular mechanisms in the 
absence of the complexity of our in vivo model, and for corroborating data from in vitro studies of HCMV 
latency and reactivation. Upon completion, our studies will have identified signaling pathways that lead to 
epigenetic reprogramming of viral chromatin to reactivate latent MCMV and potential therapeutic targets. This 
project has considerable synergy with Project 2, which will investigate inflammatory and epigenetic factors that 
control HCMV latency and reactivation, and Project 3, which will investigate complications due MCMV infection 
and inflammation on tolerance to donor-specific antigens.","activating transcription factor; Acute; Allogenic; allotransplant; Alpha Cell; Antigens; Antiviral Agents; Binding; Bone Marrow; Bone Marrow Cells; Cell Differentiation process; Chromatin; Clinical; clinically relevant; Collaborations; Complement; Core-Binding Factor; Cytokine Activation; Cytomegalovirus; Cytomegalovirus Infections; Data; demethylation; Early Promoters; Epigenetic Process; Gene Expression; gene repression; Genetic Transcription; Genome; Hematopoietic; Hematopoietic stem cells; Herpesviridae; histone demethylase; histone methylation; histone methyltransferase; Histones; Homologous Transplantation; Human; Immediate-Early Genes; Immune; immunosuppressed; In Vitro; in vitro Model; in vivo; in vivo Model; Infection; Inflammation; Inflammation Mediators; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Response; inhibitor/antagonist; insight; Interleukin-1; Interleukin-18; Interleukin-6; Kidney; Kidney Transplantation; kidney vascular structure; Kinetics; Latent Virus; Lead; Lysine; lytic replication; Mediating; Methylation; Modeling; Modification; Molecular; monocyte; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Mus; Natural immunosuppression; neutralizing antibody; novel; novel strategies; Organ; Organ Transplantation; pathogen; Pathway interactions; prevent; programs; promoter; reactivation from latency; Regimen; Regulation; response; Role; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Signal Transduction Pathway; Simplexvirus; Site; Species Specificity; Study models; synergism; targeted treatment; Testing; Therapeutic Intervention; therapeutic target; TNF gene; TNFRSF5 gene; transcription factor; Transcription Factor AP-1; Transcription Repressor/Corepressor; Transcriptional Activation; Transplant Recipients; Transplantation; Viral; Viral Genes; Viral Genome; Virus; Virus Latency",NA

Because these target the viral DNA polymerase, they are only active after the virus has reactivated from latency. Their effectiveness is also limited by toxicities and
by the emergence of resistant strains. Donor- specific allo-immune tolerance, whereby a transplant recipient is hypo-responsive to donor antigens but continues to have intact immune-responsiveness to other foreign antigens has been the `Holy Grail' of transplantation since the early 1950's. Recently, several experimental protocols have achieved this goal, and the `era of tolerance' seems near. Prior studies have demonstrated that murine CMV (MCMV) reactivation requires the combination of an allo-inflammatory response and immunosuppressive drugs (ISD), while a donor-specific tolerant model would abrogate the inflammatory response, and avoid the need for ISD. Also recently, two central themes have emerged from a combination of studies of animal models of MCMV reactivation and ex vivo/in vitro models of HCMV reactivation: expression of viral genes involved in lytic replication is repressed by epigenetic factors that induce heterochromatinization of viral genomes; and signaling pathways activated by an inflammatory immune response induce reactivation of the virus through epigenetic reprogramming of viral DNA, such that the immediate early genes are released from transcriptional repression, leading to lytic replication. These themes form the basis for studies proposed in 3 separate but inter-related projects studying: 1) Mechanisms of reactivation of latent MCMV following kidney transplantation in a clinically relevant model; 2) Mechanisms of latency and reactivation of HCMV in myeloid lineage cells; and 3) MCMV infection, latency and reactivation in transplantation tolerance. Three Cores will support services needed for the successful completion of studies within these Projects: A) Microvascular surgery and histopathology; B) Precision cell isolation and analysis; and C) Administrative services. The unifying and central hypothesis of the Program Project is that reactivation of latent CMV is induced by inflammatory mediators, which activate signaling pathways, leading to epigenetic reprogramming of viral genomes, resulting in induction of immediate early (IE) gene expression, and ultimately, to reactivation of infectious virus. We believe that blockade of these signaling pathways, either by interfering with specific signaling pathways, blocking epigenetic modifications, or by donor- specific tolerance, prevent reactivation of CMV. We anticipate that integrating mechanistic insights derived from the three projects in this highly collaborative effor will be decisive in moving the field forward and in fostering the development of novel strategies to prevent, rather than treat CMV reactivation.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Reactivation of latent Cytomegalovirus (CMV) remains an important clinical problem following transplantation with two recent developments forming the basis for this proposal: first, a central mechanistic theme has emerged from in vitro and in vivo studies of HCMV and MCMV respectively; and second, the current paradigm of transplantation is shifting towards donor-specific tolerance. Together, these developments call for integration of molecular mechanistic insights from diverse models and reactivation, and an exploration of uncharted waters regarding how CMV might behave in tolerant recipients. Three separate but inter-related projects, and three supporting cores in a collaborative research initiative designed to accelerate the development of potential therapeutic strategies to prevent, rather than treat CMV reactivation.","Acute; Animal Model; Antigens; Antiviral Agents; Bone Marrow; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Differentiation process; Cell Lineage; Cell Separation; Chromatin; Chronic; Clinical; Clinical Research; clinically relevant; Cytomegalovirus; Cytomegalovirus Infections; design; Development; DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase; Effectiveness; Environment; Enzymes; Epigenetic Process; Fostering; Gene Expression; gene repression; genome-wide; Goals; Graft Rejection; Hematopoietic stem cells; histone modification; Histones; Histopathology; Human; Immediate-Early Genes; Immune; Immune response; Immunosuppressive Agents; improved outcome; In Vitro; in vitro Model; in vivo; Infection; Inflammation Mediators; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Response; insight; Kidney Transplantation; Lead; Life; lytic replication; Mediating; Modeling; Modification; Molecular; Molecular Virology; mouse model; Murid herpesvirus 1; Mus; Myelogenous; Myeloid Progenitor Cells; Natural immunosuppression; novel strategies; Operative Surgical Procedures; Organ Transplantation; Pharmaceutical Preparations; prevent; programs; prophylactic; Protocols documentation; public health relevance; reactivation from latency; Research; resistant strain; Services; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Site; synergism; Testing; Therapeutic; Toxic effect; transcription factor; Transplant Recipients; Transplantation; Transplantation Tolerance; viral DNA; Viral Genes; Viral Genome; Virus; Virus Latency"

Transplantation of latently infected kidneys into NSG recipients results in reactivation of latent virus in the donor kidney, which disseminates systemically. Reactivation of HCMV is associated with various inflammatory insults. Our preliminary data shows that IL-6, soluble CD40L, IL-18, and LIF are elevated in the plasma of recipient mice with timing consistent with a causal role in reactivation. IL-6 induces reactivation of HCMV in hematopoietic cell models.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a competing renewal of the ""Squirrel Monkey Breeding and Research Resource"" (SMBRR), P40 OD010938 which has received continuous NIH grant support since 1980. The SMBRR is the only national research resource of laboratory born squirrel monkeys available to NIH grantees, intramural research programs of federal agencies including the FDA, NSF, and the NIH, and other sponsors of biomedical research (private foundations, pharmaceutical companies, and contract research organizations). Because some squirrel monkey species are no longer available from source countries and there are no other breeding colonies of pedigreed squirrel monkeys available for biomedical research, the SMBRR is a unique research resource that cannot be duplicated or replaced. The overall goals of the SMBRR are to provide a national research resource of squirrel monkeys; provide squirrel monkey derived biological materials; provide education and training opportunities to scientists, colony managers, and animal caregivers; and, provide investigators with facilities and expertise to conduct studies using squirrel monkeys. The scarcity of squirrel monkeys, difficulties associated with captive breeding, challenges associated with their care and use in research, all contribute to the need for this national research resource The SMBRR has integrated multiple disciplines into a program designed to meet the needs of investigators who utilize the resources provided by the SMBRR. The SMBRR has focused much of its effort on understanding the natural biology, reproductive biology, and diseases of squirrel monkeys with an emphasis on models of human disease. In the coming years, the SMBRR will continue to improve the resources it provides and continue to add new information about the biology and research value of squirrel monkeys. Squirrel monkeys continue to be used extensively in neuroscience research, drug addiction research, malaria research, and fundamental evolutionary biology. New areas of research requiring squirrel monkeys continue to emerge. As these new research areas develop, the SMBRR plays an essential role by providing the animals, biological resources, and the expertise needed to carry out research in squirrel monkeys. In the next five years, the SMBRR will increase the animals and related resources that can be provided to the scientific community. The SMBRR plans to organize and sponsor a squirrel monkey genomics workshop. Biomedical scientists who use squirrel monkeys to study human diseases and geneticists will share their expertise to determine how genome sequencing and subsequent identification of SNPs can be used to increase the value of the squirrel monkey model in human health research. The proposed applied research projects (Applied Research Component) will add new information about squirrel monkeys. This information will further refine and add value to the resources provided by the SMBRR.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ""Squirrel Monkey Breeding and Research Resource"" (SMBRR) maintains the only self-sustaining national research resource of laboratory-born squirrel monkeys, their tissues and other biological materials, and the expertise to carry out research in this important research animal. Scientists with NIH grants utilize squirrel monkeys to study many diseases that threaten human health including alzheimer's disease and other disorders of the central nervous system, drug addiction, malaria, and viral diseases. The resources provided by the SMBRR reduce the need for importation of squirrel monkeys by providing highly defined animals and biomaterials that scientists can use to either reduce the number of animals needed or eliminate the need for living animals in their research.","Address; Adjuvant; Age; Alzheimer's Disease; Anatomy; Animal Experimentation; Animal Model; Animals; Applied Research; Area; Behavior; Biocompatible Materials; Biological; Biology; Biomedical Research; biomedical scientist; Blood; Breeding; Caregivers; Caring; Cells; Central Nervous System Diseases; Cesarean section; chromosomal location; Communities; Country; cross reactivity; Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes; Dendritic Cells; design; Dimensions; Discipline; Discipline of obstetrics; Disease; Doctor of Philosophy; Doctor of Veterinary Medicine; Drug Addiction; Dystocia; Educational workshop; Female; Foundations; Genetic; genetic pedigree; genome sequencing; genome-wide; Genomics; Goals; Grant; Health; Human; human disease; Immunologics; Immunology; improved; Incidence; Injury; Intramural Research Program; Knowledge; Laboratories; Lead; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Malaria; Measures; Modeling; Molecular; mortality; Natural Killer Cells; Neurosciences Research; novel; Pelvic floor structure; pelvic organ prolapse; perinatal morbidity; Pharmacologic Substance; Phase; Play; Positioning Attribute; Pregnancy; Preventive treatment; Privatization; Production; programs; public health relevance; Reagent; Reproduction; reproductive; Reproductive Biology; Research; Research Contracts; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; research study; Resources; Role; Route; Saimiri; scaffold; Scientist; Services; sex; social; social group; Source; Spottings; Stillbirth; Striated Muscles; Testing; Time; Tissues; tool; Training and Education; training opportunity; United States National Institutes of Health; vaccine delivery; Vaginal delivery procedure; Virus Diseases; web site; whole genome"

 The overall goal of this Phase II project is to validate novel leishmanial protein biomarkers for
development of a non-invasive urine-based assay to diagnose active visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and to
monitor the therapeutic efficacy of this serious disease. VL is endemic in 47 countries, affects 500,000
people a year and kills more than 50,000, 70% of them children under age 15. VL, also known as kala-azar, is
caused by parasites of the Leishmania donovani complex: L. donovani and L. archibaldi in the Old World
(primarily India and South Eastern Africa), and L. infantum in the New World (Southern Europe and South
America). Global VL morbidity and mortality in many parts of the world are increasing due to co-infection with
human immunodeficiency virus. Although VL is usually fatal if not treated promptly, the effective drugs are
toxic, expensive and difficult to administer, and untreated people with VL are reservoirs of infection who put
others in their communities at risk. The gold standard for diagnosis is observation of the parasites (or
detection of parasite DNA) in spleen, liver, lymph node or bone marrow aspirates; serum tests measure anti-
parasite antibodies, which cannot distinguish between active VL from either prior exposure to the parasite or
subsequent to successful treatment of the disease. There is no vaccine for human VL. The WHO has defined
that a key requirement for effective control of this serious worldwide disease is a sensitive non-invasive test
that can rapidly and reliably diagnose active VL and identify people who need immediate treatment.
 Our former published work and the Phase I component of this Phase II application have established the
foundation for the development of a simple non-invasive urine test to both diagnose active VL and to monitor
the therapy efficacy of this disease. We used mass spectroscopy to initially identify three L. infantum and more
recently four new L. donovani proteins excreted in the urine of VL patients. We characterized these antigens,
raised polyclonal antibodies against them and developed an antigen detection capture ELISA to diagnose VL.
A pilot clinical study defined that the three proteins of L. infantum were present in the urines 19/20 well
characterized New World VL patients and in none of more than 60 control urines samples from healthy
subjects as well as from non VL patients like suffering from cutaneous leishmaniasis, Chagas’ disease,
schistosomiasis and tuberculosis. We are currently validating the recently discovered L. donovani markers.
 For this Phase II proposal we will use a large panel of urine samples from different areas of the world
where VL is endemic to validate all seven discovered L. infantum and L. donovani biomarkers as reliable tools
for the accurate diagnosis of active VL and to monitor the therapy of this disease. In addition to a solid
preliminary data, a strength of this proposal is our access to a unique resource of urine samples from
confirmed VL patients from VL endemic regions around the world.","Project Narrative
Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) a serious disease caused by the parasites Leishmania donovani/Leishmania
infantum. The disease affects 500,000 people a year and kills more than 50,000, 70% of them children
under age 15. Diagnosis is usually carried out using invasive and inadequate tests (liver, spleen, or bone
marrow biopsies) and/or by antibody detection tests that cannot distinguish active disease from previously
sensitized healthy subjects or from treated and cured patients. The present project proposes to validate a
unique non-invasive reliable assay that we have developed for the accurate diagnosis of this disease. The
assay detects Leishmania proteins that are eliminated in patient’s urine. Such test distinguishes active disease
from both previously sensitized healthy subjects and from cured patients. In addition, the assay will be a useful
tool to monitor the therapy of VL, an unmet and much needed tool because the therapeutic drugs are toxic and
because of the alarming increase in parasite resistance to the available drugs.","accurate diagnosis; Affect; Age; Antibodies; Antigens; Area; Aspirate substance; Award; base; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; biomarker development; biomarker selection; Bone Marrow; Bone marrow biopsy; Chagas Disease; Child; Clinical; Clinical Research; co-infection; commercialization; Communicable Diseases; Communities; Complex; cost; Country; Cutaneous Leishmaniasis; Data; Detection; Development; Diagnosis; diagnosis standard; Disease; disease diagnosis; DNA; Eastern Africa; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Epitopes; Evaluation; Exposure to; Foundations; Freezing; Future; Goals; Gold; HIV; Human; India; Individual; Infection; Killings; Leishmania; Leishmania donovani; Leishmania infantum; Liver; lymph nodes; Mass Spectrum Analysis; Measures; Monitor; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Non-Visceral; novel; Parasite resistance; Parasites; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; polyclonal antibody; Production; protein biomarkers; Proteins; Publishing; Resources; Risk; Sampling; Schistosomiasis; Sensitivity and Specificity; Serum; Small Business Innovation Research Grant; Solid; South America; Southern Europe; Specificity; Spleen; Standardization; System; Testing; Therapeutic; tool; Toxic effect; Treatment Efficacy; Tuberculosis; Urine; Vaccines; Validation; Visceral Leishmaniasis; Work"

 6 this critical need and focus their scientific efforts on diabetes. We are seeking support for 6 postdoctoral
 7 positions. Both physician and PhD scientists will be trained and most will be appointed to the program for 2
 8 years. There exist no other diabetes research training opportunities in the state. The program is built on the
 9 myriad strengths of the University of Iowa Fraternal Order of Eagles Diabetes Research Center (FOEDRC),
10 which is driving innovative strategies aimed at further understanding the pathophysiology of diabetes and its
11 complications and at devising novel preventative and curative strategies. Training in basic and clinical scientific
12 investigation will be backed by a core curriculum in diabetes, metabolism, grant writing, and research ethics.

The long-term goal of this proposal is to understand the mechanisms linking these metabolic disorders and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction prior to and in concert with heart failure. Obesity is associated with insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia. Epidemiological studies suggest that hyperinsulinemia is an independent risk factor for heart failure. In humans and mouse models, the heart may retain its insulin sensitivity in terms of insulin's ability to activate IRS1, PI3K ad Akt signaling, despite insulin resistance in other organs such as the liver and skeletal muscle. This hyperinsulinemia also accelerates adverse LV remodeling in pressure overload hypertrophy and genetic reduction of insulin signaling in cardiomyocytes limits hypertrophic remodeling and reduces apoptosis in pressure overload, thereby preserving LV function. Our recent studies reveal that hyperinsulinemia desensitizes <U+FFFD>R-mediated stimulation of cardiac contractility, which represents a novel mechanism linking insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia and LV dysfunction. This proposal, will therefore focus on the hypothesis that hyperinsulinemia might attenuate LV contractility by directly impairing <U+FFFD>or <U+FFFD>-adrenergic (<U+FFFD>) signaling. Specifically, activation of cardiomyocyte insulin receptors (IR) in hyperinsulinemic states, impairs <U+FFFD> signaling via two distinct mechanisms: (1) Increased <U+FFFD>R/Gi coupling that inhibits adenylyl cyclase and cAMP production, and (2) Increased expression of PDE4D that increases cAMP degradation. This multi PI proposal reflects an active collaboration by the laboratories of Evan Dale Abel (University of Iowa) and Yang Kevin Xiang (University of California -Davis). Our combined expertise in myocardial insulin signaling and myocardial adrenergic signaling will address this hypothesis in the following two specific aims. Aim 1 (Xiang). Will define the molecular mechanisms by which insulin impairs <U+FFFD> signaling in cardiomyocytes by testing the following hypotheses: Insulin signaling increases <U+FFFD>R/Gi coupling via a complex containing <U+FFFD>R, IR, IRS, and GRK2 that inhibits adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP generation. Insulin signaling enhances cardiac PDE4 levels via <U+FFFD>R-ERK dependent modulation of PDE4 transcription and protein turnover. Aim 2 (Abel). Will determine the physiological consequences of <U+FFFD>-IR interactions in hearts in vivo by testing the hypotheses that: Acute or chronic hyperinsulinemia will impair myocardial <U+FFFD> signaling and reduce contractility or inotropic reserve and that hyperinsulinemia in obesity, T2DM and heart failure will exacerbate cardiac dysfunction by impairing inotropic reserve. By using novel molecular biosensors to define subcellular adrenergic signaling domains in cardiomyocytes and a comprehensive array of mutant mouse models with perturbed IR or <U+FFFD> signaling, we will dissect the mechanism for IR-<U+FFFD> crosstalk that limits myocardial contractility in insulin resistant states.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart failure is a leading cause of mortality in the United States. Obesity and insulin resistance are independent risk factors for heart failure. The present study will address the critical question of the role of altered beta-adrenergic signaling in the pathophysiology of cardiac dysfunction in obesity, type 2 diabetes, and other insulin-resistant states. We will determine if augmented myocardial insulin signaling, as a consequence of the hyperinsulinemia that develops in obesity and type 2 diabetes, directly impairs the ability of adrenergic signaling to enhance cardiac contractility. These studies will provide novel information regarding modulation of beta-adrenergic signaling pathways in the prevention or treatment of cardiac dysfunction in obesity and type 2 diabetes.","Acute; Address; Adenylate Cyclase; ADRBK1 gene; Adrenergic Agents; Affect; Animals; Apoptosis; Attenuated; base; Biosensor; California; Cardiac; Cardiac Myocytes; Cardiomyopathies; Chronic; Collaborations; Complex; constriction; Coupling; Cross Syndrome; Cyclic AMP; Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases; desensitization; Diabetes Mellitus; Diet; epidemiology study; Fatty acid glycerol esters; Functional disorder; Gene Targeting; Generations; Genetic; Genetic Transcription; Glucose Intolerance; glucose uptake; Goals; Heart; Heart failure; Human; Hyperinsulinism; Hyperlipidemia; Hypertrophy; Impairment; in vivo; Infusion procedures; Insulin; Insulin Receptor; Insulin Resistance; insulin sensitivity; insulin signaling; Iowa; IRS1 gene; Isoproterenol; Knock-out; Laboratories; Left; Left Ventricular Dysfunction; Left Ventricular Function; Left Ventricular Remodeling; Link; Liver; Mediating; Metabolic; Metabolic Diseases; Molecular; mortality; mouse model; Mus; Muscle Cells; mutant mouse model; Myocardial; Myocardial dysfunction; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; novel; Obesity; Organ; phosphodiesterase IV; phospholamban; Phosphorylation; Physiological; Population; pressure; prevent; Prevention; Production; protein degradation; Proteins; public health relevance; response; Risk Factors; Role; Series; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Skeletal Muscle; Testing; trafficking; type I diabetic; United States; Universities; Ventricular; Ventricular Remodeling; western diet; Yang"

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and insulin resistance are independent risk factors for heart failure. The long- term goal of this proposal is to understand the relationship between hyperinsulinemia and cardiac dysfunction in these populations. Hyperinsulinemia may also accelerate adverse LV remodeling in pressure overload hypertrophy and genetic reduction of insulin signaling in cardiomyocytes limits hypertrophic remodeling and reduces apoptosis in pressure overload, thereby preserving LV function. Our recent studies reveal that hyperinsulinemia desensitizes ß-AR-mediated stimulation of cardiac contractility by promoting ß2ARGi-biased signaling and by inducing the phosphodiesterase (PDE4D), which represents a novel mechanism linking insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia and LV dysfunction. This proposal will test the hypothesis that hyperinsulinemia attenuates LV contractility by directly impairing <U+F062>AR signaling via two distinct mechanisms: (1) Increased <U+F062>2AR/Gi coupling that inhibits adenylyl cyclase (AC) and cAMP production, and (2) Increased expression of PDE4D that increases cAMP degradation. This multi PI proposal reflects an active collaboration by the laboratories of Evan Dale Abel (University of Iowa) and Yang Kevin Xiang (University of California -Davis). Our combined expertise in myocardial insulin signaling and myocardial adrenergic signaling, using novel molecular biosensors to define subcellular adrenergic signaling domains in cardiomyocytes and a comprehensive array of mutant mouse models with perturbed IR or ßAR signaling, will address this hypothesis in the following three specific aims. Aim 1 (Xiang): Will define the molecular mechanisms for and consequences of PDE4 induction in response to chronic hyperinsulinemia. Hypothesis: Insulin signaling reduces cAMP levels by increasing cardiac PDE4 levels for cAMP hydrolysis via <U+F062>2AR-ERK dependent modulation of PDE4 transcription and protein turnover. Aim 2 (Abel): Will determine the mechanisms by which modulation of IR-<U+F020><U+F062>2AR signaling may attenuate obesity associated LV dysfunction. Hypothesis: Acute or chronic hyperinsulinemia will impair myocardial ßAR signaling and reduce contractility or inotropic reserve by promoting cAMP degradation and genetic or pharmacological inhibition of this crosstalk will preserve LV function in hyperinsulinemic states. Aim 3 (Abel). Will determine if IR-<U+F020><U+F062>2AR crosstalk contributes to LV dysfunction in heart failue or in subjects with insulin resistance. Hypothesis: LV or atrial tissue from subjects with heart failure will reveal molecular signatures consistent with increased IR-<U+F020><U+F062>2AR ERK activation and PDE4 induction, and insulin resistant subjects will exhibit impaired heart rate responses to sub-maximal exercise. These studies will comprehensively dissect the mechanism for IR-<U+F020><U+F062>AR crosstalk that limits myocardial contractility in insulin resistant states, and may lead to novel approaches for treating or preventing heart failure in the high risk population with insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart failure is a leading cause of mortality in the United States.

He completed a fellowship in urologic oncology at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, where he gained experience in basic and translational research methods. His past record of achievement is exceptional, including 11 manuscripts on renal cell carcinoma (RCC). His current position allows significant protected time for research, which he has used to develop preliminary data for this proposal. His immediate career goals focus on gaining the scientific knowledge and experience necessary to become a productive independent investigator in the field of RCC cell signaling. Long term career goals include establishing a RCC translational research program and developing therapies for RCC based on NF<U+03BA>B signaling. The environment surrounding Dr. Abel is ideal for his development into an independent investigator. The Department of Urology has a history of multiple NIH funded investigators and is committed to his success. Dr. Shigeki Miyamoto is a basic scientist and world expert in NF-<U+03BA>B signaling who is dedicated to the close mentorship of Dr. Abel and his scientific career development. Dr. David Jarrard is a successful physician- scientist, who will serve as a co-mentor and work closely with Jason to facilitate his success in this competitive environment. Dr. Abel's career development plan takes advantage of the training opportunities, collaboration and didactic coursework which make the University of Wisconsin one of the top research institutes in the world. An estimated 65,000 patients in the US will be diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2012. Metastatic RCC is a lethal disease with few treatments, and most patients survive less than 2 years after diagnosis. RCC is a highly vascular tumor, producing angiogenic and growth factors triggered by over-expression of hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) with recent studies demonstrating that the HIF2a subunit, specifically, plays a causal role in carcinogenesis and progression. Our preliminary studies have demonstrated a previously unknown concordant activation of NF-<U+03BA>B with increased HIF2a expression in RCC preclinical models and clinical samples, suggesting they are functionally related. The purpose of this proposal is to investigate the hypothesis that activation of the NF-<U+03BA>B/HIF2a axis promotes RCC tumor growth. In Aim 1, we will investigate the functional significance of the NF-<U+03BA>B/HIF2a axis using in vitro experiments. Given the probability of significant interaction from the microenvironment, we have designed Aim 2 to evaluate whether the NF-<U+03BA>B/HIF2a axis may indirectly promote tumor growth in RCC xenografts. In Aim 3, we will determine the clinical and pathologic outcomes associated with NF-<U+03BA>B activation/HIF2a expression. This proposal is innovative because it investigates NF-<U+03BA>B/HIF2a interaction, which is a novel pathway in RCC. Our project is significant because RCC progression is driven by HIF signaling and increased understanding of the NF-<U+03BA>B/HIF2a axis may allow development of new therapies for this incurable disease.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Survival for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains poor despite many new treatments and there is a critical need to develop new therapeutic approaches.

PROJECT SUMMARY
Description: The Preclinical Models Core (PMC) supports IDDRC users who seek new treatments for IDD by
studying these disorders in 3 kinds of preclinical models: (1) Rodent models: This Core component
characterizes behaviors in mouse models of genetic or acquired disabilities. Measured behaviors include
learning, memory, social preference, ultrasonic vocalization, sleep and anxiety. (2) Stem cell models: This
Core component assists users to create disease models by generating induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)
using standard reprogramming technologies or by genome editing, such as CRISPR-Cas, on established iPSC
lines. These cells, some derived from humans with IDD, afford a model in which to scrutinize cellular
consequences of genetic disease and to evaluate the efficacy of possible therapies. (3) Tissue culture models:
This Core component supports users to generate tissue culture models in which to study the development and
behavior of enriched or mixed populations of primary brain cells, including neurons, astrocytes,
oligodendroglia, microglia and endothelia. These cells originate in genetically manipulated rodents or they are
normal cells exposed to environmental stimuli, including drugs and toxins. The Tissue Culture Service and
Stem Cell Service interact closely, since they share several in vitro methodologies and serve as a conduit to
drive and help design rodent behavior testing.
The PMC emphasizes training of users and their staff. Trained users can continue studies in their own
laboratory or they can utilize the equipment in the PMC at reduced cost. This core interacts with others in the
Center. It will exchange protocols, services and best practices with other IDDRCs in the Network.
Relevance to IDDRC Mission: The PMC bridges all three domains of “Genes, Brain, and Behavior”, the theme
of the CHOP/Penn IDDRC (see Overall: Overview of Center). The Core was developed in response to a user
survey (2014) that emphasized a need for an IDD-focused facility for the study of mammalian behavior and
one to address the potential of current stem cell technologies, including CRISPR-Cas.
Eligibility: These services are available both to approved users of the IDDRC at CHOP/UPenn and to users at
other Centers in the Network.","Address; Anxiety; Articulation; Astrocytes; Behavior; behavior test; Behavioral; Bioinformatics; Biological Assay; Biometry; Brain; brain behavior; brain cell; Cell Differentiation process; Cell Line; Cell model; Cells; Cellular biology; Clinical; Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats; Consultations; cost; Data; Data Analyses; design; Development; disability; Disease; Disease model; Education; effective therapy; Electroencephalography; Eligibility Determination; Ensure; Equipment; Experimental Designs; experimental study; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Models; Genetically Modified Animals; genome editing; Health Services Accessibility; Hematopoietic; Hereditary Disease; Human; implantation; improved; In Vitro; in vitro Model; induced pluripotent stem cell; Laboratories; Learning; Maintenance; Measures; member; Memory; Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Research Centers; Methodology; Methods; Microdissection; Microglia; Mission; Modeling; Monitor; Motor; mouse model; Mutation; neurochemistry; neuroimaging; neuromuscular; Neurons; Normal Cell; novel; Oligodendroglia; Patient Recruitments; Patients; Performance; Peripheral; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phenotype; Population; Pre-Clinical Model; preference; Procedures; Process; Production; Protocols documentation; Publications; Reflex action; Research Personnel; response; Rodent; Rodent Model; Services; Skin; Sleep; social; Social Interaction; Somatic Cell; stem cell technology; Stem cells; Stimulus; Structure; Surveys; System; Techniques; Technology; Testing; tissue culture; Tissue Harvesting; Toxin; Training; Treatment Efficacy; Ultrasonics; Virus; vocalization",NA

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): New experiences are initially encoded as labile short-term memories, which are converted into stable long-term memory by gene transcription-dependent processes. In the hours after learning, the induction of gene expression follows a specific pattern that involves transient waves of transcriptional activity, which are needed for memory consolidation. Recent work has also identified persistent, long-lasting transcriptional changes that are induced by learning, which appear to contribute to storage of long-term memory. It is emerging that this transcription is regulated by epigenomic mechanisms such as histone acetylation and DNA methylation. These epigenetic modifications are critical for the long-lasting regulation of gene expression during development and may be a major mechanism of information storage in the brain. Changes in epigenetic modifications occur in animal models of depression and anxiety disorders, and alterations in DNA methylation have been found in post-mortem brains from patients with post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, autism and bipolar disorder. Defects in epigenetic modifications may contribute to impairments in synaptic plasticity and cognitive function associated with many psychiatric disorders. Our work suggests that epigenetic modifications are a critical component of both synaptic plasticity and memory formation and storage, but the genes targeted by these epigenetic regulatory processes remain unknown. In this application, we propose three Specific Aims to address these issues. In Specific Aim 1, we will examine the role of the NR4A ""orphan"" nuclear receptors, which are critical for long-term memory and long-term potentiation, as well as for the enhancement of memory and plasticity by HDAC inhibition. We will define the key NR4A target genes required for hippocampus-dependent memory and test if the NR4A transcription factors are novel targets for cognitive enhancement. In Specific Aim 2, we will define the molecular mechanisms through which the co-repressor SIN3A, which coordinates a transcriptional regulatory complex that includes histone-modifying enzymes HDAC1 and HDAC2, negatively regulates long-term memory and synaptic plasticity. Specific Aim 3 will build on evidence that a persistent long-lasting increase in the expression of transcription factor NFIL3 contributes to long-term memory storage in the hippocampus, thus defining the persistent transcription that mediates long-term memory storage in the hippocampus. Our understanding of the master transcriptional regulatory proteins involved in consolidation and storage of long- term memory may ultimately lead to the development of new treatments for the debilitating cognitive deficits associated with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cognitive deficits are a debilitating component of a number of psychiatric disorders, but current therapeutic approaches do little to combat these deficits. Disruption of epigenetic modifications, such as histone acetylation, may underlie these cognitive deficits, and this proposal seeks to define the target genes regulated by epigenetic changes during memory storage. Knowledge of the molecular mechanisms and targets of epigenetic modifications during memory storage promises to lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression.","Address; Animal Model; Anxiety Disorders; Autistic Disorder; Autopsy; Binding Sites; Bipolar Disorder; Brain; chromatin immunoprecipitation; Cognitive deficits; cognitive enhancement; cognitive function; combat; Complex; Data; Defect; density; Dependovirus; depression model; Development; differential expression; DNA Methylation; Enzymes; Epigenetic Process; epigenetic regulation; epigenomics; Event; excitatory neuron; experience; Family; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Regulation; gene induction; Gene Silencing; Gene Targeting; Genes; genetic approach; Genetic Transcription; HDAC1 gene; HDAC2 gene; Hippocampus (Brain); Histone Acetylation; Histone Deacetylase; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor; histone modification; Histones; Homer 1; Hour; Impairment; Information Storage; Knowledge; Lead; Learning; long term memory; Long-Term Potentiation; Maintenance; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; Memory; memory consolidation; Mental Depression; Mental disorders; Modeling; Modification; Molecular; Mutant Strains Mice; novel; novel strategies; novel therapeutic intervention; Nuclear Family; Nuclear Orphan Receptor; Nuclear Receptors; Patients; Pattern; Pharmacology; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders; Process; programs; Proteins; public health relevance; Publishing; pyrosequencing; Regulation; Reporting; Repression; Repressor Proteins; Role; Scaffolding Protein; Schizophrenia; Short-Term Memory; Signal Transduction; Sin3A protein; Synapses; Synaptic plasticity; targeted treatment; Testing; Therapeutic; Transcript; transcription factor; Transcription Process; Transcription Regulatory Protein; Transcriptional Regulation; Work"

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major identifiable cause of nosocomial antibiotic-associated diarrhea. In the US alone, there are approximately 500,000 CDI cases annually, with a mortality rate >2.5%. The annual CDI-associated costs are estimated at $3.2 billion. The infectious form of C. difficile is the spore, a
resistant structure that can survive on hospital surfaces for extended periods.  C. difficile spore do not cause disease, but can revert to toxin-producing bacteria (a process called germination) in the microbiota-depleted gut of hospitalized patients. We have found a synthetic bile salt (CamSA) that inhibits C. difficile spore germination and more importantly protects mice from CDI without toxic effects. CamSA also synergizes with vancomycin to protect hamsters from CDI. Although CamSA has many attractive properties, it still needs to be optimized for pre-clinical trials. We have assembled a team with complementary expertise to help improve the pharmacological properties of CamSA. At the start of this project, we will finish optimizing the necessary assays using CamSA as our lead compound. The data acquired for CamSA will serve as benchmarks for new analogs (specific aim 1) to be tested in vitro and in vivo (specific aims 2-4). At each step, GO/NO GO criteria will eliminate sub-optimal analogs. The information gathered will be used to inform the rational design and synthesis of more potent and stable anti- germinants. This iterative process will be continued until an optimized CDI prophylactic lead is obtained. The specific aims are designed to be interdependent. CamSA has already moved through much of this process since it was easily synthesized (specific aim 1), tested in a battery of in vitro assays (specific aim 2), and tested as a CDI prophylactic in rodents (specific aim 3). Moreover, we have ""primed the pump"" by finding three new anti-germinants that are ready for in vitro and in vivo testing.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Spores of the bacterium Clostridium difficile can cause hospital-borne infections that put cancer, AIDS, and transplant patients at risk.

Among such PD risk variants, the alpha-synuclein (aSyn) locus is of particular interest, as SNPs in this locus show the strongest and most robust impact on sporadic PD risk Furthermore, very rare mutations in aSyn as well as triplication of the aSyn gene locus lead to familial inherited forms of PD. aSyn is thus an attractive therapeutic target for PD, with most strategies aimed at reducing its level or aggregation. Our preliminary data point to a novel regulatory mechanism that we hypothesize to impact aSyn physiological and pathological functions: aSyn messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript differential 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) usage. Longer transcript isoforms (aSynL) correlate with increased protein accumulation, intraneuronal protein redistribution, and pathological functions, both in human brain and in model systems. This ultimately may provide a novel therapeutic approach by targeting specifically pathological rather than physiological functions of aSyn. aSyn 3'UTR usage is modified by dopamine exposure as well as by aSyn locus common genetic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants that increase PD risk. The 2 mechanisms appear largely separate. Whereas a small segment of the 3'UTR (sufficient to confer dopamine sensitivity) is conserved in rodent aSyn, most of the 3'UTR sequences are unique to human. Our specific hypothesis is that longer mRNA transcript isoforms of human aSyn, with extended 3'UTRs, aSynL, play important pathological roles, by impacting the accumulation of aSyn protein. The goals of this proposal are to (i) define regulatory mechanisms of the aSyn 3'UTR and (ii) relate the molecular properties of different aSyn mRNA 3'UTR isoforms to pathological aSyn functions in vivo. The impact of this proposal is potentially high, as pinpointing a specific pathogenic transcript would present a novel therapeutic target. Such regulation could be especially amenable to high-content drug screens. The deliverables of the project are (i) to provide a structure/function analysis of aSyn 3'UTR sequences with respect to aSyn regulation, and (ii) to potentially identify novel drug targets for PD and other synucleinopathies, by identifying molecular mechanisms that mediate the process.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a tremendous need for therapeutics that alter the course of Parkinson's disease.

outcomes. Since 2007, he has published 52 peer-reviewed research papers, including 45 related to critical
care EEG and seizure management with 33 as first or senior author. To advance this line of investigation, Dr.
Abend needs to extend his observational studies into interventional clinical trials capable of establishing
whether optimized ES interventions improve neurobehavioral outcomes. The proposed training in clinical trial
design, execution, data management, and team-science skills will optimally position Dr. Abend to conduct
multi-center clinical trials of innovative neuroprotective strategies for children with acute brain injuries.
Research: Dr. Abend’s K23 research has demonstrated that ES occur in 10-40% of children with acute brain
injuries, and that EEG monitoring is required for identification since most ES lack any observable clinical
correlate. Additionally, he has shown that high ES exposure is associated with unfavorable neurobehavioral
outcomes after adjusting for brain injury severity and critical illness severity. Based on these data, an
increasing number of children are undergoing EEG monitoring in pediatric intensive care units, and recent
guidelines recommend widespread EEG monitoring use in critically ill children with acute brain injuries to
identify ES. However, it is concerning that children experiencing high ES exposures have unfavorable
outcomes despite current clinical efforts to manage ES. This problem prompts a critical need to develop
optimized ES management strategies that are more targeted, appropriate, and timely to better mitigate ES
induced secondary brain injury. Dr. Abend’s overall objective is to address several clinical trial readiness gaps
important in conducting subsequent clinical trials of optimized ES management. Aim 1 will generate and
validate a predictive model using clinical and EEG variables to discriminate between acutely encephalopathic
critically ill children who will and will not subsequently experience high ES exposures. This cohort is known to
have worse outcomes with current management and would be predicted to benefit from optimized
management. Determining the cohort’s characteristics will be the foundation for selecting a cohort for
subsequent clinical trials of ES management. Aim 2 will determine the safety and feasibility of a targeted and
timely ES management intervention in critically ill children. In contrast to standard care which slowly identifies
ES and escalates medications, the high-intensity multi-modal intervention consists of frequent full-array EEG
review, rapid anti-seizure medication initiation following ES onset, and rapid administration of sequential anti-
seizure medications at high doses if ES persist. In working towards a clinical trial addressing ES management,
sub-aims will assess other clinical trial readiness gaps including the number of eligible patients, participant and
clinician randomization willingness, and statistical analysis of outcome measure variation which will provide
effect size estimates to inform the design of subsequent trials. Aim 3 will provide Dr. Abend with advanced
training in multi-center clinical design and execution using a combination of advanced didactic coursework,
training from investigators experienced in leading acute neurologic clinical trials, and practical experience
conducting a clinical trial (Aim 2). This research is innovative since it will develop the first model to predict high
ES exposure and thereby identify an optimal cohort for inclusion in subsequent studies, and it will perform the
first safety and feasibility assessment of a standardized ES intervention in critically ill children. These
contributions are significant because they provide a foundation for subsequent clinical trials that will potentially
yield new neuroprotective strategies for children with acute brain injuries.
Environment and Career Development: The training plan builds upon the mentorship and research
infrastructure at the University of Pennsylvania and The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia that have
supported Dr. Abend’s current productivity. The plan involves (1) didactic coursework focused on clinical trials,
patient outcomes research, regulatory issues, and team-science skills, and (2) training from investigators
experienced with each component required to conduct clinical trials focused on seizure management in
critically ill children, and (3) practical experience conducting a clinical trial. This training will allow Dr. Abend to
develop and execute subsequent clinical trials of neuroprotective strategies in critically ill children.
Summary: The research aims, training plan, and world-class clinical research infrastructure at the University of
Pennsylvania and The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia assure that Dr. Abend will become an even more
productive independent clinical investigator who will excel at leading multi-site clinical trials focused on
improving outcomes for critically ill children with acute brain injuries.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
The proposed research is relevant to public health because electrographic seizures are common in
critically ill children with acute brain injuries and optimized electrographic seizure management is predicted
to improve patient outcomes. This research will (1) develop and validate a model predicting which critically
ill children with acute brain injuries are at high risk for electrographic status epilepticus, (2) assess the
safety and feasibility of an optimized high-intensity multi-modal electrographic seizure identification and
management intervention, and (3) provide the primary investigator with advanced clinical trial training
needed to advance this line of investigation. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to NIH’s mission
since it is expected to lead to a novel neuroprotective strategy that reduces the burden of neurologic
disease.","Acute; Acute Brain Injuries; Adaptive Behaviors; Address; base; Brain Injuries; career; career development; Cerebrum; Characteristics; Child; Clinical; Clinical Investigator; clinical practice; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; Clinical Trials Design; cohort; Conduct Clinical Trials; Consensus; Critical Care; Critical Illness; Critically ill children; Data; data management; design; Dose; Effectiveness; Electrographic Status Epilepticus; Eligibility Determination; Environment; Epidemiology; Epilepsy; expectation; experience; follow-up; Foundations; Future; Goals; Guidelines; high risk; Hour; improved; improved outcome; innovation; Intervention; Investigation; investigator training; K-Series Research Career Programs; Lead; Mentors; Mentorship; mid-career faculty; Mission; Modality; Modeling; Monitor; multi-component intervention; Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke; nervous system disorder; neurobehavioral; Neurologic; Neurological outcome; Neurology; novel; Observational Study; Outcome; Outcome Measure; Outcomes Research; Paper; Participant; Patient-Focused Outcomes; Patients; Pediatric Hospitals; Pediatric Intensive Care Units; Pediatrics; Pennsylvania; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Philadelphia; Positioning Attribute; predictive modeling; Productivity; prospective; Public Health; Publishing; Quality of life; Randomized; Readiness; Research; Research Infrastructure; Research Peer Review; Research Personnel; Resources; retention rate; Risk; safety and feasibility; Science; Seizures; Severity of illness; skills; standard care; Standardization; Statistical Data Interpretation; Surveys; therapy development; Time; Training; trial design; United States National Institutes of Health; Universities; Variant; willingness; Work"
"1R01MH109525-01A1","SCHIZOPHRENIA CASE-CONTROL STUDY OF NEONATAL AND POST ONSET METHYLOMES","ABERG, KAROLINA ANNA","ABERG, KAROLINA ANNA","PROJECT SUMMARY
Schizophrenia (SZ) is a devastating psychiatric illness with a complex etiology. While genetic sequence
variation clearly contributes to SZ development, knowledge of DNA methylation patterns may provide
complementary information. First, methylation studies may provide additional insights into disease processes.
For example, as methylation may directly regulate gene expression and is mutable in postmitotic tissues, it
provides functional information unobtainable by sequence alone and can account for clinical phenomena such
as the dynamic course of illness including cycles of remissions and relapses. Second, the translational
potential of methylation studies is profound. For example, pathogenic environmental events may leave
methylation signatures in blood, traces of which can be preserved during cell division. As methylation marks
can be measured cost-effectively in (histone-free) genomic DNA, they can potentially increase the predictive
power of algorithms based on sequence variation.
 Two complications hamper inferences in methylation studies of SZ. First, there are many possible
differences between SZ cases and controls that may affect the methylome including lifestyle differences,
disease induced psychological stress, smoking and antipsychotic use. Rather than methylation affecting SZ
susceptibility, the direction of effect could be reversed with the disease causing methylation changes. Second,
the procurement of brain tissue is not possible in living patients. It is therefore important to study the
methylome using a combination of blood samples, which can reveal useful biomarkers, and in brain tissue,
which can help identify biologically relevant functions regulated by methylation.
 To address these complications we propose to study the methylomic profiles of SZ cases/controls in blood
samples collected at birth. Because these samples were collected years prior to any SZ symptoms, it is
logically impossible for SZ disease related confounders to cause the associations. Next, to generate causal
hypotheses that can potentially be followed up with functional experiments, we integrate the pre SZ onset
findings with methylation and transcription data from post SZ onset blood and brain samples using a logically
rigorous analytical framework. As detailed knowledge is lacking about disease relevant methylation sites, we
propose to assay all ~27 million CpGs in the human genome in all our samples.
 Successful completion of this proposal will identify biomarkers and functional methylation marks for SZ
generally, and may specifically identify markers with potential to predict SZ risk. Such findings would be of
considerable value for improving SZ treatment and care.","NARRATIVE
DNA methylation studies offer great potential to improve the understanding of schizophrenia but the critical
questions of whether associated methylation marks truly indicate disease risk, or if they reflect changes caused
by the disease, or disease related confounders, remain to be investigated. Our goal is to disentangle these
questions by studying the methylome in human samples collected pre- and post schizophrenia onset. The
successful completion of the proposed work may identify biomarkers and functional methylation marks for SZ
in general and may specifically identify markers with potential to predict SZ risk, which would be of tremendous
value for improved SZ treatment and care.","Address; Affect; Affinity; Algorithms; Antipsychotic Agents; Autopsy; base; Binding; Bioinformatics; Biological; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; Birth; bisulfite sequencing; Blood; Blood specimen; Brain; brain tissue; Caring; case control; Case-Control Studies; Cell division; cell type; Clinic; Clinical; clinical application; Collection; Complex; Computer software; cost; Cost Measures; Data; design; Development; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; Diet; Disease; Disease remission; disorder risk; DNA; DNA Methylation; Early Diagnosis; Ethics; Etiology; Event; experimental study; follow-up; Gene Expression; Genetic; Genetic Transcription; Genomic DNA; Genomics; Goals; Gold; Hematological Disease; Histones; Human; Human Genome; improved; Individual Differences; innovation; insight; Investigation; Knowledge; Life; Life Style; Light; Measures; Mental disorders; Methods; Methylation; methylation biomarker; methylation pattern; methylome; Neonatal; novel; outcome forecast; Pathogenicity; Pathway Analysis; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pattern; Performance; Phenylketonurias; Predisposition; Process; Protein Binding Domain; Psychological Stress; Relapse; Risk; risk variant; Sampling; Schizophrenia; screening; Site; Smoking; Spottings; Symptoms; Testing; theories; Tissues; Transcript; transcriptome; transcriptome sequencing; transcriptomics; Validation; Variant; whole genome; Work"

 Gadolinium-based contrast agents have been widely used in clinical magnetic resonance
imaging studies. However, despite their exceptional safety reputation, serious toxicity issues
associated with the use of these agents have emerged in the last several years, with studies
demonstrating the release of gadolinium (Gd) and subsequent deposition in bone tissue and in
the brain in patients with normal renal function and intact blood-brain barriers. The only practical
therapy to reduce the health consequences of gadolinium deposition is treatment with chelating
agents that form excretable complexes, although gadolinium, like other heavy metals, is among
the most intractable elements to decorporate. Over the past three decades, the Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory has dedicated a research program to the development of oral
therapeutics for actinide decorporation, leading to the emergence of the active pharmaceutical
ingredient 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) as an exceptional candidate for actinide sequestration. Initially
driven by the civilian need for post-exposure medical countermeasures against nuclear threats,
the development of 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) followed a program that references the Animal Rule
approval path established by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and focused on pre-
clinical pharmacology and toxicology, formulation optimization, as well as controlled efficacy for
the removal of injected threat radioisotopes (plutonium, americium, curium, uranium or
neptunium). In addition, the oral formulation of 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) makes it the first oral and
indisputably most efficacious therapeutic actinide decorporation product. The Investigational
New Drug (IND, 112,264) status was obtained in August 2014 for this drug product. However,
while the preclinical development program has focused on demonstrating the outstanding
decorporation efficacy of 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) in vivo for radioactive actinides exclusively, recent
solution thermodynamic studies have confirmed its extremely high affinity for other f-elements,
including Gd. In the proposed research project, we will explore the potential 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO)
as a Gd decorporation agent that may be used in anticipation of, during, or after administration
of Gd-based contrast agents. Animal studies using established models will be performed to
adequately characterize the efficacy profile of 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) for eliminating deposited Gd
or for preventing deposition, without altering the potency of the contrast agent for imaging. The
data gathered through this program will benefit from and be added to the body of data already
available for the IND-approved product, which may then lead to an enlarged indication and
prospects of clinical studies and use in the very near future.","Project Narrative

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) have a high rate of tobacco smoking and pharmacotherapies have shown limited benefit so far. This is of great concern, considering the high mortality and morbidity in this population.  Deep repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of insular and prefrontal cortices at high frequency, using the H4 coil - termed also the H-ADD coil, has shown benefit in a study in healthy smokers in reducing smoking and achieving abstinence. Within this R21/R33 mechanism we propose to test high frequency stimulation of the insula in the treatment of tobacco smoking in patients with SCZ. In the R21 phase we will test the effects of 3 weeks of daily rTMS stimulation (versus sham) to the insula and other cortical regions on the choice to self-administer tobacco in 30 patients with schizophrenia who are also heavy smokers, using a laboratory model of tobacco choice to detect a therapeutic effect. We will also assess target engagement of the insula by examining treatment induced changes in insula cerebral blood flow (CBF) measured with arterial spin labeled (ASL) MRI imaging from pre to post treatment. In addition, we will measure the resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the insula before and after treatment, to searc for a potential circuitry based biomarker as a correlate of the therapeutic effect. The overall hypothesis is that deep rTMS with the H-ADD coil will engage the insula (target engagement measured with decrease in CBF) and that 3 weeks of high frequency rTMS administration will reduce the choice to self-administer tobacco. We further propose that this therapeutic effect could be mediated by a change in the FC of the insula. If we measure significant changes in ASL and in choice of cigarettes in active vs sham stimulation groups, we will proceed to phase 2 (R33) of the project. In the R33 phase 30 patients will receive active deep rTMS and thirty will receive sham. We will test the effects of deep rTMS on tobacco abstinence at 6 months and test whether insula rsFC change induced by rTMS predicts therapeutic response.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Patients with schizophrenia have a high rate of tobacco smoking, which is detrimental to their health. Here we will test in two stages the potential benefi of deep neurostimulation targeting the insula to reduce smoking in patients with schizophrenia. First we will evaluate behavioral effects using a cigarette self- administration laboratory model and show that treatment targets the insula using MRI imaging of insula blood flow and, if successful, then we will test efficacy in reaching tobacco abstinence.","Abstinence; Acute; addiction; Aftercare; base; behavior measurement; Behavioral; Bilateral; Biological; Biological Markers; Blood flow; Brain; Carbon Monoxide; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Cigarette; Clinical Treatment; Clinical Trials; Cocaine Dependences; Collaborations; Comorbidity; Cotinine; efficacy testing; Frequencies; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; functional MRI scan; General Population; Health; Human; Image; Insula of Reil; Investigational Drugs; Laboratories; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Maintenance; Measures; Mediating; member; Methodology; Modeling; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; multidisciplinary; Neurobiology; Nicotine; Nicotine Dependence; Patient Recruitments; Patients; Pharmacotherapy; Phase; Phased Innovation Awards; Play; Population; Prefrontal Cortex; public health relevance; Randomized; repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation; Reporting; Rest; Role; Scanning; Schizophrenia; Self Administration; Self-Administered; Smoke; Smoker; Smoking; smoking cessation; smoking prevalence; Spin Labels; Structure; Substance Use Disorder; Symptoms; Testing; Therapeutic Effect; Tobacco; tobacco abstinence; Tobacco smoking; Tobacco use; treatment response; Urine; varenicline; Withholding Treatment; Work"

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal focuses on the role of auditory perception, a subconstruct within the cognitive systems domain of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), in the pathophysiology of auditory perceptual disturbances in health and across traditional (DSM-IV and DSM-V) disease categories. The overall aim is to characterize the neurobiological and neurocomputational basis of auditory sensory learning to identify pathophysiological mechanisms leading to auditory perceptual disturbances and, specifically, auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH). We aim to recruit the following groups: schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder with low- and high-severity AVH (n=15 and n=15, respectively), delusional disorder (delusional psychosis without AVH; n=15), tinnitus (auditory perceptual disturbances without AVH; n=15), and matched healthy controls (varying degrees of subclinical perceptual disturbances; n=30).

IHD is the leading cause of death and morbidity in the USA. Increase in coronary vessel diameter by vasodilatation (acute response), and increase in vessel density (delayed response) are two major defenses of myocardium from ischemic insults. While coronary vasodilatation is primarily dependent on endothelium-generated nitric oxide (NO), the increase in capillary density initially requires proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells (ECs). Increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are often observed in many cardiovascular diseases, including IHD, giving rise to the notion that ROS cause endothelial dysfunction. However, recent major interventional clinical trials using antioxidants (e.g. HOPE, ATBC), have largely produced negative results in reducing primary endpoints of cardiovascular death and morbidity. Reports from our lab demonstrated that reduced ROS levels inhibited signal transduction events that are essential for NO generation in the vascular endothelium and for coronary vasodilatation. Preliminary Results also showed that c-Src responds to changes in endothelial redox levels and promotes downstream Pl3K-Akt signaling, which in turn activates eNOS and inhibits the growth inhibitory transcription factor, FOXOi, in coronary vascular ECs. This application will test a novel HYPOTHESIS that conditional increase in endothelium-specific-ROS will activate c-Src-Pl3K-Akt-eN0S pathway and inhibit FOXO1, and thus, will result in coronary vasodilatation and increased vessel density in a myocardial ischemia model in vivo. Utilizing a newly developed binary transgenic mice that can induce conditional expression of Nox2 and 2-fold increase in ROS in vascular endothelium, we will determine whether EC-ROS activate c-Src-Pl3K-Akt signaling, proliferation and migration of mouse heart ECs in vitro (Aim 1); whether EC-ROS induce Pl3K-Akt-eNOS activation, NO synthesis and coronary vasodilatation (Aim 2); and whether EC-ROS increase vessel density in ischemic myocardium in an LAD ligation model in vivo (Aim 3).","RELEVANCE (See instructions): Ischemic heart disease is caused by reduced blood supply to the heart muscle by dysfunctional coronary blood vessels, and is the number one cause of death and morbidity in the USA. The current proposal will address this critical issue by attempting to stimulate new blood vessel formation in diseased heart by short term, localized increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the innermost layer of coronary blood vessels.","Acute; Address; AKT Signaling Pathway; Animal Model; Anti-inflammatory; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Antioxidants; base; Biology; Blood capillaries; blood vessel development; Blood Vessels; Caliber; capillary; Cardiopulmonary; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cardiovascular system; Cause of Death; Cell Proliferation; Centers of Research Excellence; Cessation of life; Clinical; Clinical Trials; Coronary; Coronary Arteriosclerosis; Coronary Circulation; Coronary Vessels; Cysteine; density; Disease; Endothelial Cells; endothelial dysfunction; Endothelium; Event; Foundations; FOXO1A gene; Generations; Goals; Growth; Heart; Heart Diseases; Hypoxia; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; in vivo Model; Infarction; injury and repair; insight; Instruction; Intervention; Ligation; Mediating; migration; Modality; Morbidity - disease rate; Mus; Myocardial Ischemia; Myocardium; Nitric Oxide; novel; novel therapeutics; Outcome; Oxidants; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxides; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Reactive Oxygen Species; Reporting; response; Role; Signal Transduction; SRC gene; Sulfhydryl Compounds; Testing; Tetanus Helper Peptide; Tetracyclines; tissue culture; Tissues; transcription factor; Transgenic Mice; Vascular blood supply; Vascular Endothelial Cell; Vascular Endothelium; Vasodilation; Withdrawal"

The proposed study will specifically answer to questions whether: (1) immediate turning of growth cone depends on the difference between the concentration gradients on the left- and right-hand sides of the growth cone; (2) immediate and biased turning and growth-rate modulation work together to guide axons towards their targets; (3) integration of gradients of multiple cues can provide a precise regulation mechanism for axonal guidance. Axons are guided along specific pathways by gradients of attractive and repulsive cues in their extracellular environment. To understand the effect of gradients of guidance cues individually or in combination on growth cone turning and growth rate modulation, the development of platforms that are capable of producing precisely controlled shape gradients of guidance cues is essential. I propose to develop an inexpensive and high- throughput technology that is capable of providing precise, reproducible, and arbitrarily shaped gradients of physical and biochemical cues to direct and modulate axonal growth. For these studies, we will first fabricate aligned nanotubes of conducting polymer loaded with nerve growth factor on micro-fabricated electrode arrays. To release the entrapped nerve growth factor, we will actuate these nanotubes by applying electrical voltages. By varying the actuating voltage across the electrode array, we will create precisely controlled gradients of released nerve growth factor on these microelectrodes. Next, we will generate gradients of substrate-bound molecules, in this case laminin, on conducting polymer nanotubes across the electrode array. Inclusion of laminin on the nanotubes will be achieved by using this protein as a dopant during electropolymerization of conducting polymer. We will employ different concentrations of laminin on individual electrode sites to achieve the desired gradient profile. To generate gradients of surface topography, we will create gradients in diameter and surface roughness of aligned conducting polymer nanotubes on the micro-fabricated electrode arrays. We will modulate (a) the diameter of conducting polymer nanotubes by varying the time of electrochemical polymerization of conducting polymer, and (b) the surface roughness of conducting polymer nanotubes by varying the current density applied during electrodeposition. Finally, we will develop a 3D conduit consisting of a PDMS guidance channel that contains nanostructured conducting polymers that provide (i) physical and biochemical growth cues, and (ii) low impedance electrodes to monitor axonal growth by electrophysiological recording along the regeneration pathway. This multifunctional conduit will be tested in vitro and vivo to determine the effect of gradient of multiple guidance cues on axonal growth direction and rate. The results of these studies may significantly impact society by paving the way for a solution to the major clinical problem of axon regeneration and guidance.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a type of heart disease characterized by poor pumping function. DCM is the most common cause of heart failure and is also the leading reason for heart transplantation. Many causes of DCM are unknown and the disease may be mild to severe. Optimization of the drug regimen for DCM may take months to years, with some patient refractory to treatment, resulting in progressive heart failure, heart transplantation, or death. Since the drug regimen for DCM treatment frequently varies from patient to patient, the current lack of a model system in the dish prevents accurate validation of treatment plans and prediction of drug side- effects. Current validation of long-term treatment in the laboratory employs traditional electrophysiology, both a time-consuming and destructive method for interrogating heart cell electrical activity. In order to trac the efficacy of applied drugs and detect potential long-term side-effects, what is needed is an engineered heart muscle (EHM) system that recapitulates the salient disease features of DCM and whose function can be both controlled and monitored acutely and chronically, precisely and non- destructively. To create this system, the candidate proposes (1) to create and characterize stem cell- derived heart cells that can be controlled and monitored with light, a technology called
optogenetics; (2) to create and characterize optogenetic DCM-EHM made from these modified heart cells; and (3) to use optogenetic DCM-EHM to screen drugs that best mitigate the deleterious features of the disease. The candidate has a significant track record of research in optogenetics, stem cell biology, tissue engineering, and cardiovascular disease, and will expand his technical skills and career development activities by closely interacting with his faculty mentor, advisory committee, and collaborators in those areas. At the end of the K01 award, the candidate's goal is to successfully obtain R01 funding.

"5R01NS091329-03","PERK AS A CENTRAL MEDIATOR OF NEUROTOXICITY IN TAUOPATHIES","ABISAMBRA, JOSE FRANCISCO","ABISAMBRA, JOSE FRANCISCO","<U+FEFF>   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tauopathies are a group of nineteen known debilitating neurodegenerative disorders that affect nearly eight million people in the United States. Currently, there is no cure for tauopathies, and there are temporary and limited benefits to current therapeutic strategies. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor PERK (protein kinase R-like ER kinase) has been identified as a participant in the pathogenesis and progression of tauopathies. However, the mechanism by which the PERK pathway causes neuronal dysfunction is still unknown. The long-term goal is to better understand the mechanism(s) that induce(s) neuronal dysfunction in tauopathies, and the overall objective is to determine the mechanism by which tau and PERK synergize to induce neuronal dysfunction. The central hypothesis is that tau and PERK engage in a pathological cycle whereby aberrant accumulation of tau chronically activates PERK, and active PERK activates enzymes that contribute to the production of pathogenic tau. The overall consequence of this cycle is potentiation of tau pathogenic pathways as well as chronic inhibition of protein synthesis. Characterizing the role of the PERK pathway in neuronal dysfunction will identify novel, urgently needed therapeutic targets for tauopathies. The hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims. Aim 1 is designed to determine the extent to which the PERK pathway causes neuronal dysfunction in tauopathies. Aim 2 is designed to determine the mechanism by which PERK activity modulates tau pathology. Finally, Aim 3 will determine the extent of PERK pathway activation in a newly described tauopathy called Primary Age-Related Tauopathy (PART). In Aim 1, we will use pharmacologic and genetic approaches to inhibit PERK in in vivo, in situ, and in vitro models of tauopathy; neuronal function will be measured by cognitive tests, a novel and non-invasive imaging approach called manganese-enhanced MRI, and electrophysiological measurements. Secondly, we will use biochemical, immunohistochemical, and gene expression assays to determine the extent of PERK activity. In Aim 2, we will use pharmacologic and genetic approaches to activate and inhibit PERK in in vivo and in vitro models of tauopathy; we will measure changes to pathological tau and the PERK pathway. Finally, in Aim 3, we will measure changes in the levels of PERK pathway markers and pathological tau in PART CSF and brain parenchyma. This will be the first extensive biochemical approach to PART, which could unveil novel biomarkers of the disease. The identification of a pathogenic PERK-tau cycle is innovative because it departs from the status quo by identifying an effector of disease (PERK) that can cause neuronal dysfunction (downstream) while also potentiating tau aberrancies (upstream). Therefore, the PERK pathway offers a unique repertoire of novel therapeutic targets that can modulate disease in multiple aspects. This approach is significant because of the central role the pathway plays in disease, and therefore, the potential to offer therapeutic solutions to tauopathies.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it aims to identify a pathway known as PERK as a contributor of damage to neurons in nineteen related neurodegenerative disorders called tauopathies, the most common of which is Alzheimer's disease. These diseases present irreversible and severe brain atrophy and cognitive impairment and impact millions of people. Discovery of the mechanisms by which PERK damages neurons in the brain will establish a specific target that may lead to development of novel therapeutics.","Acute; Affect; age related; aging population; Alzheimer's Disease; attenuation; base; Biochemical; Brain; brain parenchyma; CASP3 gene; Caspase; cell immortalization; cerebral atrophy; Cerebrospinal Fluid; Chemosensitization; Chronic; Cleaved cell; Code; Cognition; Cognitive; cognitive testing; Data; Defect; Dementia; design; Development; Disease; Disease Progression; Distributional Activity; effective therapy; Electrophysiology (science); Endoplasmic Reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum stress; Enzymes; Gene Expression Profiling; Genes; genetic approach; Goals; Homeostasis; Human; imaging approach; immortalized cell; Impaired cognition; Impairment; improved; In Situ; in vitro Model; in vivo; Individual; innovation; Lead; Link; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Manganese; Measurement; Measures; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; Modeling; Morphology; mouse model; Mus; Nerve Degeneration; Neurodegenerative Disorders; Neurofibrillary Tangles; Neurologic Deficit; Neuronal Dysfunction; Neurons; neurotoxicity; new therapeutic target; non-invasive imaging; novel; novel marker; novel therapeutics; Outcome; Participant; Pathogenesis; Pathogenicity; Pathologic; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pharmacology; Phosphotransferases; Play; Prion Diseases; Production; Progressive Supranuclear Palsy; Protein Biosynthesis; protein kinase R; Protein Synthesis Inhibition; Proteins; Public Health; public health relevance; Reporting; Research; Risk; RNA; Role; sensor; Slice; Synapses; tau aggregation; tau mutation; tau Proteins; Tauopathies; Tenuate; Testing; Therapeutic; therapeutic target; Time; Transgenic Mice; Translations; United States; Work"

"2R01HL031823-27A1","HEME SYNTHESIS, USE AND TRAFFICKING DURING ERYTHROPOIESIS","ABKOWITZ, JANIS L","ABKOWITZ, JANIS L","Project summary/abstract.
An adult makes 2.4 million red cells per second and production increases 5-10-fold as the physiological
response to anemia. Over 95% of red cell protein content is hemoglobin; each cell contains 270 million
hemoglobin molecules; each molecule contains two a and two ß-globin chains plus four heme moieties; yet
free-heme is toxic and must be tightly regulated. As expected from these rapid kinetics, CFU-E/early
proerythroblasts are especially vulnerable to heme toxicity since this is when heme synthesis intensifies but
globin expression is low. Our previous studies demonstrate that the heme exporter, FLVCR, is critical at this
stage and functions as a safety valve, exporting excessive heme. The goals of this competitive renewal
application are to study how heme regulates normal red cell differentiation and to determine why excess heme
results in cell death. Since heme is synthesized from succinyl CoA (a TCA cycle intermediate) and glycine (an
amino acid) and functions as a sensor of metabolic need and protein availability, these data should also
provide insight into other quick on-off processes regulated by heme, such as circadian rhythm and N-end rule
pathway protein ubiquitination.
The observation that anemia occurs when the synthesis of heme in CFU-E/proerythroblasts exceeds its use (in
hemoglobin) or export (via FLVCR) also prompts our studies of Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA) and the
myelodysplasia resulting from the isolated deletion of chromosome 5q (del(5q) MDS). These clinical disorders
are characterized by haploinsufficiency of ribosomal proteins and poor ribosomal assembly. During the last
funding cycle, we showed that although heme synthesis initiates normally, globin translation is slowed. Heme
exceeds the capacity of FLVCR and induces excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell death. We
propose to investigate the fate of individual early erythroid cells from Flvcr-deleted mice and DBA and MDS
patients, using single cell RNA sequencing (in collaboration with Qiang Tian PhD and colleagues at the
Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, WA) and have excellent leads into heme’s role in regulating red cell
differentiation and into the consequences of excessive heme from our preliminary investigations. We will
also study ferroptosis, a recently described, poorly understood, non-apoptotic cell death pathway, involving P53
activation, decreased transcription of the cysteine/glutamate amino acid transporter SLC7A11, and an increased
sensitivity to ROS. Since increased P53 activation also characterizes DBA, this mechanism would link our
observations to other published data. We also have shown that slowing heme synthesis (or increasing heme
export) improves the red cell production of Flvcr-deleted mice in vivo and DBA and del(5q) MDS patient marrow
in vitro and will use this information to develop new therapeutic strategies for treating these disorders and
potentially other anemias characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis.","Public health relevance/ project narrative.
Since anemia affects ~30% of persons worldwide and is a major cause of morbidity, understanding how red
cells mature is important. Mice lacking FLVCR, a heme export protein, develop a severe anemia and
macrocytosis (large red cells), akin to children with Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA) and adults with
myelodysplasia (MDS). By investigating mouse models in vivo, and DBA and MDS patient marrow cells in vitro,
we will determine how and why early red cells die. These studies should provide new insights into the molecular
and cellular processes regulating red cell differentiation and the pathophysiology of these diseases. They should
also define new therapeutic strategies to ameliorate erythroid marrow failure and improve anemia.","Adult; Affect; alpha-glycerophosphoric acid; Amino Acid Transporter; Amino Acids; Anemia; base; beta Globin; Binding; Carrier Proteins; Cell Death; Cell Differentiation process; Cell physiology; Cell surface; Cell Surface Receptors; Cells; CFU-E; Child; chromosome 5q loss; Chromosome Deletion; Circadian Rhythms; Citric Acid Cycle; Clinical; Collaborations; Complementary DNA; Cysteine; Cytokine Receptors; Data; Decision Making; design; Diamond-Blackfan anemia; Disease; Doctor of Philosophy; Dominant-Negative Mutation; Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes; Effectiveness; Ensure; env Gene Products; Erythrocytes; Erythroid; Erythroid Cells; erythroid differentiation; Erythropoiesis; expression cloning; Failure; Feline Leukemia Virus; Felis catus; Functional disorder; Funding; GATA1 gene; Genetic Transcription; Globin; Glutamates; Glycine; Goals; Grant; Heme; heme a; Hemoglobin; Human; Impairment; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; in vivo Model; Individual; Inorganic Phosphate Transporter; insight; Institutes; Investigation; Kinetics; lactose permease; Link; Macrocytic Anemia; Marrow; member; Metabolic; Molecular; Morbidity - disease rate; mouse model; Mus; novel; novel therapeutic intervention; novel therapeutics; Observational Study; Oxalates; Pathway interactions; Patients; Persons; Physiological; Physiology; Population; prevent; Process; Production; Pronormoblasts; Protein Export Pathway; Proteins; public health relevance; Publishing; Reactive Oxygen Species; receptor; response; Ribosomal Proteins; Ribosomes; Role; Safety; sensor; Series; Signal Pathway; Subgroup; succinyl-coenzyme A; Surface; Systems Biology; time interval; Toxic effect; TP53 gene; trafficking; transcriptome sequencing; Translations; Ubiquitination"

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rationale: Despite recent progress in treatment of melanoma, the metastatic form of the disease remains highly drug- resistant and frequently fatal. The reactivation of tumor-suppressive pathways constitutes an under-explored research avenue and presents a strategic opportunity to develop novel therapeutic interventions for this devastating disease. The explosion of data from genome-wide analysis technologies has produced a wealth of information on the genomic landscape of tumors, including mutation hotspots and copy-number alterations. Here I propose to utilize these data and analyze the functional relevance of candidate tumor- suppressor genes for melanoma formation. Research: The aims of this project are: 1) to assess the tumor-suppressive potential of ARID2, a gene encoding a chromatin regulator frequently mutated in human melanomas, and to analyze its mechanism of action, and 2) to identify the tumor-suppressor gene in a region of chromosome 10 frequently lost in human melanomas and to decipher its associated signaling pathway. I will use the zebrafish as a model organism to study the in vivo effect of gene knock-out on tumor initiation. The zebrafish is particularly suited for these studies because zebrafish embryos are genetically malleable, their large numbers provide statistical power to tumor-incidence curves and a reliable fish melanoma model is readily available. I have developed a technique for tissue-specific inactivation of genes in the zebrafish based on the CRISPR technology of genome-editing that I recently published in Developmental Cell. I will use it to evaluate the loss- of-function phenotype of candidate tumor-suppressor genes in zebrafish melanoma. The preliminary data I have obtained demonstrates the feasibility of this approach. Finally, I will investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of action of the identified tumor-suppressors. I expect that this research plan will yield crucial new insights into tumor-suppressive pathways in
melanoma and result in the development of novel therapeutic approaches. Career plan: My long-term career goal is to lead a world-class laboratory in the forefront of cancer biology with a
particular focus on the development of innovative therapies based on the analysis of tumor- suppressive mechanisms. I intend to use both the mouse and the zebrafish as investigation tools and preclinical models. To complement my knowledge of mouse models of cancer acquired during my PhD, I will carry out the mentored phase of this Award as a postdoctoral Research Fellow in the laboratory of Dr. Leonard Zon, a renowned zebrafish researcher who has made seminal contributions to the fields of developmental hematopoiesis and cancer biology. I have designed an ambitious research career development plan to achieve my immediate goals for the mentored period: 1) expand my advanced scientific and technical knowledge, and 2) prepare my transition to independence. Building on my strong background of studying cell signaling mechanisms, I will gain expertise in zebrafish techniques and perfect my cellular and molecular biology as well as biochemistry skills. Under the mentorship of Dr. Zon and a prestigious advisory committee, I will follow a structured training program to enhance my professional abilities to establish and run my own laboratory. The division of Hematology/Oncology at Boston Children's Hospital and the Harvard Medical School will provide me with the ideal environment to fully benefit from this Award and become a successful independent scientist.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE

Project Summary: International Conference on HHV-6 & 7
The 10th International Conference on HHV-6 & 7 is a three-day conference in July 2017 which will bring
together approximately 150 investigators from over a dozen countries to discuss current research topics
related to Human Herpesviruses 6A, 6B & 7. Using the standard medical conference format, investigators will
present their original research to the audience and attendees will have the opportunity to present questions,
discuss findings, and share ideas.
While the relationship between HHV-6A, HHV-6B & HHV-7 infection and some diseases such as encephalitis,
febrile seizures and febrile status epilepticus are well-established, the role of HHV-6 & 7 in other conditions
such as acute graft vs host disease, liver failure and pneumonia remains unclear. The inherited form of HHV-6
that affects 1% of the population (chromosomally integrated HHV-6) and recent data suggest that it can

Project Narrative: International Conference on HHV-6 & 7
Roseoloviruses HHV-6A, HHV-6B & HHV-7 are understudied relative to the other herpesviruses; major
complications of these viruses include HHV-6B encephalitis in the setting of hematopoietic cell transplants with
rates reported at 8% of cord blood transplants in one meta-analysis. Among many new disease associations,
HHV-6B has recently emerged as a risk factor for acute Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation and active HHV-6B/HHV-7 infection was shown to cause one third of febrile status
epilepticus in infants. In addition, inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6 (affecting 1% of the population
and 2% of patients) can be activated via immunosuppression or specific drugs such as HDAC inhibitors, with
unknown clinical consequences. Since there are only a handful of NIH grants relating to these viruses, the
conference is not possible without travel support to key speakers and investigators.","Acute; Acute Graft Versus Host Disease; Affect; Age; Animal Model; Antiviral Agents; Area; Award; bench to bedside; Berlin; Biological Assay; career; CD46 Antigen; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; cell growth; Cell physiology; Cell Transplants; Cellular biology; Charge; Childhood; Chronic; Clinical; Clinical Research; Collaborations; Communicable Diseases; Communication; Country; cytokine; Data; Dendritic Cells; Disease; Doctor of Philosophy; Dose; Encephalitis; Epidemiologist; Epidemiology; Febrile Convulsions; Fever; Fostering; Foundations; Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center; Gender; Gene Expression Regulation; Generations; Germany; Goals; graduate student; Graft-vs-Host Disease; Grant; Hematopoietic; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Herpesviridae; HHV-6A; HHV-6B; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor; Homologous Gene; Human Herpesvirus 6; Human Herpesvirus 7; Immune response; Immunocompromised Host; Immunotherapy; improved; In Vitro; Infant; Infection; Inherited; International; Laboratories; Liver Failure; Logistics; Macaca; Malignant Neoplasms; Medical; meetings; Meta-Analysis; Methods; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Biology; Multiple Sclerosis; Natural immunosuppression; Natural Killer Cells; Neurologist; novel; Organ; Participant; Pathologist; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pneumonia; Population; Prevalence; Primary Infection; programs; protein expression; Reagent; Reporting; Research; Research Personnel; response; Risk Factors; Role; Roseolovirus; Scientist; Seizures; Sensitivity and Specificity; Serological; Specialist; Status Epilepticus; Steroids; Students; symposium; Temporal Lobe Epilepsy; Testing; Transgenic Mice; Transplant Recipients; Transplantation; Travel; Umbilical Cord Blood; United States; United States National Institutes of Health; Universities; Variant; Viral; Virus; volunteer; Washington"
"5SC1GM116724-02","A NEW APPROACH FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUGS","ABLORDEPPEY, SETH Y","ABLORDEPPEY, SETH Y","<U+FEFF>   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    
Schizophrenia is a brain disorder that affects about 1% of the world's population and out of this number, up to a third of patients are treatment-resistant (TRS). In addition, schizophrenia is associated with suicidal ideation and 9-13% of patients eventually take their own lives. Even more troubling is the fact that 65 to 80 % of outpatients with chronic schizophrenia discontinue their antipsychotic medications, often because of a lack of efficacy or intolerable adverse effects. There is therefore an urgent need for new antipsychotics that promote compliance and ultimately treat the disease including the treatment resistant illness. The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop novel small molecules that promote ß-arrestin-2 recruitment to D2R and simultaneously interact at other CNS receptors involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia as new treatment options for schizophrenia. In addition, selected compounds should also not interact appreciably with receptors associated with the known side effects of current drugs. We have identified two lead compounds with this profile, SYA16263 and SYA16268 and they will form the basis of drug development to accomplish this long-term goal. The specific aims proposed to accomplish this goal, include evaluation of SYA 16263, a newly identified preclinical candidate, in a battery of tests in animal models of psychosis and to demonstrate a lack of adverse events enabling us then to move this drug or the related analog toward the clinic. Because of its newly characterized functional profile, we also plan to conduct a structure functional selectivity relationship study on SYA 16263. Specific Aim 2 will optimize the binding affinity of SYA 23013 and SYA 29875 two newly discovered agents in our labs, to D2R, 5HT1AR and 5HT7R while minimizing interactions at 5HT2BR, 5HT2CR and H1R (Ki > 500 nM). The design strategy is to obtain high potency compounds that promote b-arrestin-2 recruitment to D2R and function as antagonists (Ki<10 nM) at 5HT1AR, 5HT2AR and 5HT7R. Specific Aim 3 involves performing in vitro ADME and in vivo pharmacological evaluations of at least 1 agent per year obtained in specific aims 1 and 2 that satisfy stated physicochemical characteristics, including Lipinski's rule of five (Ro5), permeability and metabolic stability. Finally, as a faculty development grant, we also propose a specific Aim 4 which involves orchestrating a Faculty Development Strategy that will lead to obtaining non-SCORE grants. The activities include re-establishing a vibrant collaboration with experts in the field and hiring
research associates/technicians to help PI deliver on the proposal aims, to establish a compound screening lab in FAMU; to write and publish =2 articles per year and to write at least one proposal including an R21 or RO1 per year to non-SCORE funding agencies and =2 joint RO1 proposals with collaborators.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   
According to the National Institute of Mental Health, approximately 2.4 million American adults, or about 1.1 percent of the population age 18 and older in a given year, are affected by schizophrenia. Of this number, it is estimated that up to a third of patients are unresponsive to current treatment options. An even more heart-breaking statistics is the fact that between 9-13% of patients eventually takes their own lives because of the illness. Unfortunately, research reports indicate that between 65 - 80% of outpatients discontinue the use of current antipsychotic medications as a result of the side-effects associated with current drugs or their failure to treat their condition. This calls for an urgent effort to identify new agents in the pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia. The long term goal of this proposal therefore, is to develop new agents that have improved therapeutic profiles over the current antipsychotics in use. Obtaining new drugs that minimize adverse side-effects, restore executive functionality to patients and reduce health care costs associated with this debilitating illness will be a significat contribution to the nation and indeed the world. Achieving the specific aims of this proposal will move us closer to reaching the long term goal of providing adequate treatment options for schizophrenia.","Adult; Adverse effects; Adverse event; Affect; Affinity; Age; American; analog; Animal Model; Antipsychotic Agents; Apomorphine; arrestin 2; arrestin B; beta-arrestin; Binding; Biological Availability; Brain Diseases; Characteristics; Chronic Schizophrenia; Clinic; clinical candidate; Collaborations; design; Development; Disease; DRD2 gene; drug development; Drug Kinetics; Evaluation; executive function; experimental study; Failure; Feeling suicidal; Functional disorder; Funding Agency; G-substrate; Goals; Grant; GTP-Binding Proteins; Health Care Costs; Heart; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; interest; Joints; Lead; Learning; meetings; Metabolic; MK801; morris water maze; National Institute of Mental Health; Neurobehavioral Manifestations; New Agents; novel; novel strategies; novel therapeutics; Outpatients; Patients; Permeability; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacology; Pharmacotherapy; Population; Postdoctoral Fellow; pre-clinical; Procedures; Process; Property; Psychotic Disorders; public health relevance; Publishing; pyrimidine analog; Rattus; receptor; Recruitment Activity; Reflex action; Reporting; Research; Resistance; response; Schizophrenia; screening; Sedation procedure; Signal Transduction; small molecule; Social Interaction; Solubility; spatial memory; statistics; stereotypy; Structure; Symptoms; Teacher Professional Development; Testing; Therapeutic; Weight Gain; Writing"

Over the past 25 years, this program has trained post-doctoral fellows in biological and medical sciences for successful academic careers in pulmonary research and teaching. We have provided a multidisciplinary approach to both mentoring and research training that emphasizes the integration of studies at the molecular, cellular, tissue organ, and physiological (whole animals or human subjects) levels to permit rapid bench-to-bedside translation of research. Over the years, our program has primarily emphasized developing clinician-scientists to translate laboratory science with clinical research and care. We have extended our program to include more PhD scientists as faculty and trainees, and have encouraged greater cross-disciplinary interactions among basic and clinician scientists. In this renewal, we now propose to continue to expand our training program to include greater access to expertise in exciting new fields of outcomes research, epidemiology, bioengineering, epigenetics and genomics, regenerative medicine and informatics. We also seek to improve our recruitment of under-represented minority candidates and present a more rigorous mentorship program for both faculty and trainees. This approach will address the growing need to provide novel training strategies to increase opportunities for young scientists to develop successful academic careers in systems biology, team science and outcomes research, along with our more traditional strengths in laboratory investigations. Thus, our overall goal is to provide our fellows with the professional skills to lead sustained and productive academic research careers in pediatric lung diseases. Specific objectives of this program include: 1) to provide trainees wit an intensive research experience in laboratory- , patient- or population-oriented research in pediatric lung diseases by linking promising candidates with outstanding mentors who are rigorously selected based on scientific qualifications and experience in training; 2) to provide trainees with essential research skills and information regarding career development in academic medicine through structured course work, lectures and seminars, which emphasize training in ethics and scientific integrity academic ""survival skills,"" specific research tools and
exposure to diverse research methodologies; 3) to enhance and teach skills in mentorship to junior faculty through active co-mentoring of trainees with senior faculty with a formal training program. This program continues to include outstanding mentors who, in addition to success in their focused areas of research, are committed to teaching broad research skills, such as performing scholarly reviews of the literature; formulating hypotheses and study design; developing essential skills in statistics, oral and written presentation of scientific findings and
grant writing; understanding issues and defining potential problems of scientific integrity and ethics; and others. The program leadership will further ensure close monitoring of trainees' progress through the active use of individualized oversight committees. (End of Abstract)","PROJECT NARRATIVE:

"5U01HL121518-04","DATA FUSION: A SUSTAINABLE, SCALABLE, OPEN SOURCE REGISTRY ADVANCING PVD RESEARCH","ABMAN, STEVEN HERBERT","ABMAN, STEVEN HERBERT","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pediatric pulmonary vascular diseases (PVD), including pediatric pulmonary hypertension (PH), are high morbidity and mortality conditions, yet treatment options are limited. Despite new drug therapies, survival of patients with severe PH remains poor. Although most clinical studies have emphasized disease in adults, pediatric PVD can be devastating, contributing substantially to poor outcomes in newborns, infants and children that are strikingly different from those encountered in adults. Unfortunately, very few studies have addressed the safety and efficacy of PVD therapies in children. Current approaches to PVD are limited by small numbers of patients with PH and the association of PH with a variety of pediatric disorders and subspecialties at any individual center; by few established, multidisciplinary programs in pediatric PH; and by limited interactions among existing PVD programs. Multi-center investigations are necessary for sufficiently powered interventional studies, but study designs have been restricted by lack of knowledge as to disease phenotypes, clinical course, outcomes, and age-appropriate endpoints. Our objective, therefore, is the establishment and operation of a Bioinformatics Clinical Coordinating Center (BCCC) for advancing the understanding and treatment of PVD in children, comprised of national leaders in pediatric pulmonary and cardiac medicine, informatics, and biostatistics as well as registry-based and electronic health records (EHR) clinical research. We leverage and extend the existing Pediatric Pulmonary Hypertension Network (PPHnet) for large-scale registry and EHR-based research, using a well tested and widely adopted open-source data warehouse technology infrastructure (i2b2/SHRINE), developed through the NIH National Centers for Biocomputing and Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) Programs. The goal of this proposal is three-fold: (1) establish a sustainable, open source, reusable registry infrastructure across 8 PPHnet sites to capture multi-sourced EHR, ""traditional"" prospective patient-based data, and patient reported outcomes (PROs) across a large, prospective, pediatric pulmonary hypertension (PH) observational cohort; (2) enroll >500 registry subjects and capture data on >750 EHR subjects across 8 PPHnet sites, linking EHR with registry data at 3 sites; (3) address three classes of unanswered questions crucial for the characterization and management of PH, comparing the information value of registry vs. EHR vs. fused data across registry/EHR/PROs, in the domains of spectrum of PH comorbidities, PH indicators and endpoints of morbidity and mortality, and response to therapies in PH.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pediatric pulmonary vascular disease (PVD), including pediatric pulmonary hypertension, although relatively rare in childhood, exacts a disproportionately high social and economic burden on the children and their families faced with this illness, as well as society as a whole. Yet, treatment options are limited and despite new drug therapies, survival of patients with severe PVD remains poor. We therefore establish a Bioinformatics Clinical Coordinating Center, comprised of experts and centers in pulmonology, cardiology, and bioinformatics, which will collect data on the largest research population of children with this disease to-date, and analyze both registry and electronic health record data in novel ways so that we may better address the many unanswered questions of PVD in children.

 High-quality clinical data management has been a cornerstone of Rho services since its inception. Over 
the last 2 decades, Rho has served as the coordinating center for numerous NIH-sponsored observational 
studies and clinical trials, which has given us extensive experience developing, implementing, and maintaining 
innovative and reliable data systems for clinical research. In anticipation of the consolidation of study 
coordination activities across DAIT consortia, Rho has worked over the last year to standardize methods and 
processes across our current consortia. 
 The Data Management and Reporting Group Component will provide—across the 3 disease groups— 
high-quality, integrated, and secure information management systems and well-developed procedures for the 
collection of clinical and mechanistic data, the randomization of study subjects, the tracking of specimen 
collection and distribution, and the reporting of safety data. New DAIT studies coordinated by the Center will 
use the following systems for data management and reporting: 
 • Medidata Rave (an industry-leading, state-of-the-art, web-based data management tool) for the 
 receipt, entry, verification, processing, correcting, storage, tracking, transmission and reporting on all 
 clinical data and clinical laboratory data. Medidata Rave minimizes routine data entry errors and 
 boosts efficiency through robust data validation functionality that effectively turns data capture and 
 data cleaning into 1 process. 
 • RhoRAND™ for 24-7 access to participant registration and randomization using web-based or 
 interactive voice response technology. Non-computerized methods will be available if needed. 
 • Oracle Argus safety data system for entering, tracking, coding, reporting, analyzing, and archiving SAE 
 data for clinical studies in accordance with federal and international regulations. 
 Rho will carefully and comprehensively monitor accruing study data for enrollment status, visit and 
procedure completion status, and safety triggers. RhoPortal will be used across the DAIT Consortia to provide 
near real-time access to information about study progress. Any data quality or study progress metric that the 
Consortia Investigators or DAIT personnel wish to see routinely can be made available via RhoPortal. 
 We will use the CDISC CDASH standard for clinical data management for new studies managed by the 
Center. CDASH provides a study with a library of data elements that are also an industry standard and is an 
excellent starting point for efficiently setting up a clinical data management system. Rho has already begun the 
process of developing standards for forms and variables that do not exist in CDASH, but which are common 
across our studies and therapeutic areas. This “RhoDASH” global library will grow organically over time, and 
will allow us to store final study data in a standard format that can be uploaded to data sharing portals.","Access to Information; Allergic Disease; Archives; Area; Back; base; Clinical; Clinical Data; Clinical Management; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; Code; Collection; Communicable Diseases; computerized; Data; Data Base Management; Data Element; data management; Data Quality; Data Reporting; Disease; Enrollment; Ensure; Environment; experience; flexibility; Human Resources; Immune System Diseases; Individual; Industry; Industry Standard; Information Systems; innovation; International; Laboratories; Lead; Libraries; Management Information Systems; meetings; Meta-Analysis; Methods; Monitor; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease; Notification; Observational Study; Online Systems; Participant; prevent; Procedures; Process; Protocols documentation; Randomized; randomized trial; Regulation; Reporting; Research Personnel; response; rho; Safety; sample collection; Secure; Serious Adverse Event; Services; sharing data; Standardization; Study Subject; success; System; Technology; Therapeutic; Time; tool; Training; transmission process; United States National Institutes of Health; Validation; Visit; Voice; Work",NA
"5R01DA035926-04","FUNCTIONAL ROLE FOR GPR55 IN THE PERIAQUEDUCTAL GRAY","ABOOD, MARY E","ABOOD, MARY E","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): GPR55 has recently been identified as a lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI)-sensitive receptor that may also mediate some off-target effects of cannabinoids. The broad central nervous system (CNS) distribution of GPR55 suggests its involvement in central physiology and pathology. Characterization of GPR55-/- (knock-out) mice reveals roles for the GPR55 receptor in inflammatory pain, neuropathic pain, and bone development while other studies indicate that GPR55 activation is pro-carcinogenic. Importantly, GPR55-/- mice show decreased inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Further, inhibition of LPI-induced activation of GPR55 may reduce neuropathic pain. The main goal of this application is to uncover the functional role of this new receptor, GPR55, in the periaqueductal gray (PAG), one of the most important regions involved in pain modulation and also a primary site of action of many analgesic compounds including cannabinoids. Our preliminary data revealed activation of GPR55 receptors in the PAG produces increases in intracellular calcium and cytoplasmic and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in primary neurons and depolarization of PAG neurons in midbrain slice cultures. Furthermore, activation of GPR55 in PAG significantly reduced the pain threshold in rats. In other words, the activation of GPR55 in the PAG has a pro-nociceptive function. Thus, manipulating GPR55 signaling could be a new target for pain management. We propose to test a new hypothesis that the activation of GPR55 in the PAG has nociceptive response and antagonizing this receptor could have analgesic function. In the experiments under specific Aim 1, we will evaluate the GPR55-dependent Ca2+ response in PAG neurons. Studies under Aim 2 will use electrophysiology to characterize the membrane and synaptic activity responses of PAG neurons to GPR55 activation. In aim 3, we will determine the in vivo effect of GPR55 agonist(s)/antagonist(s) on PAG in several pain models.  These studies will demonstrate the functional role of GPR55 in PAG, with the objective of identifying novel targets for effective therapeutic interventions. Specifically, we will determine whether the inhibition of GPR55 by antagonist(s) can be used as potential therapeutics for pain management.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed studies will demonstrate the functional role of the GPR55 receptor in the periaqueductal gray (PAG), with the objective of identifying novel targets for effective therapeutic interventions for pain management.","Address; Agonist; Analgesics; Area; Bone Development; Brain; Calcium; Cannabinoids; carcinogenicity; Cell model; CNR2 gene; Data; drug of abuse; Drug usage; Electrophysiology (science); Endoplasmic Reticulum; experimental study; gamma-Aminobutyric Acid; genetic manipulation; Glutamates; Goals; GPR55 receptor; Image; In Vitro; in vivo; Individual; inflammatory neuropathic pain; inflammatory pain; Infusion procedures; Injection of therapeutic agent; Inositol; interdisciplinary approach; Interneurons; Knockout Mice; Lateral; lysophosphatidylinositol; Marijuana; Mediating; Membrane; midbrain central gray substance; Midbrain structure; Mitochondria; Modeling; molecular modeling; Molecular Models; Mus; NAADP; Neuraxis; Neurons; Nociception; nociceptive response; novel; Output; Pain; Pain management; Pain Threshold; painful neuropathy; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Pharmacology; Phenotype; Physiology; presynaptic; Property; public health relevance; Rattus; Reactive Oxygen Species; receptor; Regulation; response; Role; Ryanodine Receptors; Series; Signal Transduction; Site; Slice; Synapses; Synaptic Transmission; Tail; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Intervention; Translating; Treatment Efficacy; Water"

The goal of this U-01 proposal is to identify the optimal dose and schedule of carboxylesterase (CE)-secreting neural stem cells (NSCs) in combination with CPT-11 (Irinotecan) for a tumor selective, more effective treatment of high-risk neuoblastoma.

We expect that the described approach will have greatest impact in eradicating the minimum residual disease still present when high-risk patients who have achieved clinical complete remission but who a high likelihood of relapsing and ultimately dying of progressive disease. Our previous work demonstrates that: 1) intravenously administered NSCs can selectively localize to neuroblastoma tumor foci in preclinical models and 2) the NSCs can be modified to express levels of a mutant CE that in combination with a clinically relevant schedule of CPT-11 is sufficient to significantly enhance anti-tumor efficacy and long-term survival in these in vivo models. We will expand a GMP Working Cell Bank from our currently established HB1.F3.CD NSC Master Cell Bank (currently approved for clinical use in recurrent glioma patients).

Impaired mucociliary transport (MCT) is a common feature of multiple airway diseases, including cystic fibrosis
(CF). Effective MCT requires functional cilia and mucus. The mechanical properties of mucus influence MCT.
In CF, loss of bicarbonate transport in the airway epithelium decreases the pH of the airway surface liquid
(ASL). The acidic ASL changes the electrostatic interactions of mucus, making the mucus more viscous. This
defect is present at birth prior to the onset of infection and inflammation. Newborn CF pigs also have impaired
MCT. We predict that the viscous mucus in newborn CF pigs gives rise to defective MCT.
In the current application, the candidate will probe the biophysical properties of freshly isolated porcine airway
mucus using agents that alter mucus electrostatic interactions. He will assess the biophysical properties using
passive microrheology. Concomitantly, he will measure MCT in newborn CF pigs using computed tomography
(CT) and correlate how altered biophysical properties of mucus influence MCT.
The candidate's long-term career goal is to become a leader in the fields of airway biology and airway disease.
He plans to advance both fields by utilizing advanced imaging techniques and porcine models. The selection
of the porcine model is particularly relevant because the airway anatomy and physiology more closely
resemble humans than traditional rodent models.
In the current K08 application, the candidate will gain multiple intellectual, professional and technical skills to
foster his development into an independent and successful physician scientist. He has an outstanding mentor
and advisory committee that will guide him in learning passive microrheology of mucus and whole animal CT.
This topic is highly significant as mucus biophysical properties influence MCT, and thus the candidate's work
can shed light on basic biology and also potential therapeutics. In addition, the candidate will continue to
develop his manuscript and grant writing abilities through reviewing of manuscripts and grants under Dr.
Welsh's guidance. He will also take coursework in biomedical and biochemical engineering to advance his
understanding of the complex principles of rheology and imaging analyses. Lastly, the candidate will continue
to cultivate his own mentoring skills through learning how to manage timelines and budgets, as well as train
junior scientists.
In summary, this award will greatly enrich the candidate's career by providing him with additional tools

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 50% of corneal transplants, the most common form of solid organ transplantation, are performed to restore vision lost secondary to corneal endothelial failure. More than 25% of those transplants will eventually fail and endothelial cell rejection leading to failure is the single most important cause. The key to protec the endothelium is the early and accurate diagnosis of cell injury to promptly initiate treatment before irreversible damage occurs. Current diagnostic techniques fall short in protecting endothelial cells. Our pilot studies, aimed at addressing this critical need, revealed great potential of using in vivo corneal endothelium/Descemet's membrane (En/DM) characteristics, disclosed using high definition optical coherence tomography (HDOCT), in diagnosing corneal graft rejection. Yet, they also highlighted technology limitations hindering establishing this nove technique. This proposed research activity will focus on advancing HDOCT technology to better describe corneal grafts En/DM and validating, in the setting of a clinical study, the utility of th developed technology to early and accurately diagnose graft rejection. This project is led by Mohamed Abou Shousha, M.D., FRCS, Ph.D., of the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute (BPEI). He is a highly trained cornea specialist with broad experience in corneal imaging and patient oriented research. His career goals include developing the knowledge and skills to become an independent clinician-scientist while establishing diagnostic techniques to better diagnose corneal endothelial injury to decrease risk of endothelial failure and test his techniques in multi center clinical trials. The three aims of this proposal reflect his goals and include: (1) development and validation of automated En/DM tomographic thickness maps, to address technology limitations that only allow manual En/DM segmentation, which is time consuming, operator dependent and ignores tomography as an important dimension of En/DM structure. (2) Development and validation of instrumentations to extend En/DM images to include the paracentral and peripheral corneal graft, to address current technology limitation, which is the inability to describe the paracentral and peripheral En/DM despite that those are where rejection typically starts. (3) Verify the prediction that wide corneal graft En/DM tomographic thickness maps can diagnose corneal graft rejection more accurately and at an earlier stage than central En/DM thickness through a proof of concept clinical study. In addition to the research activity, he
has a highly structured career development plan to further his research skills and develop the solid base for a successful career as an independent clinician- scientist. He has assembled an outstanding mentorship team (Drs. Victor Perez, Fabrice Manns, and Sonia Yoo) with extensive experience in basic, translational and patient oriented research focused on corneal grafts rejection and biomedical corneal imaging technology. He has also developed a strong scientific advisory committee and partnerships with collaborators at the BPEI's McKnight Vision Research Center and Ophthalmic Biophysics Center to strengthen his proposal and the likelihood of both short-term and long-term success.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE

Addiction  to  cocaine  an  relapse  following  withdrawal  of  the  drug  are  associated  with  changes  in  CNS  glutamate  levels  and  homeostasis.    It  has  been  demonstrated  that  Ceftriaxone,  a  cephalosporin  antibiotic,  increases  the  expression  and  function  of  the  major  glutamate  transporter  GLT
1  (Rothstein  et  al,  2005).  Ceftriaxone has also been shown to increase the activity of system xC-, which exchanges extracellular cysteine  for  intracellular  glutamate  (Lewerenz  et  al,  2009).    Basal  non-synaptic  glutamate  levels  in  the  nucleus  accumbens  are  largely  controlled  by  system  xC-,  and  a  decrease  in  its  activity  is  the  cause  of  the  altered glutamate  homeostasis  observed  in  this  brain  region  following  cocaine  self-administration 
and  extinction  training  in  rats  (Baker  et  al,  2003).  The  catalytic  subunit  of  xC-  is xCT,  and  we  have  demonstrated  that  expression  of  xCT  and  GLT-1  are  decreased  in  the  nucleus  accumbens  core  following  cocaine  self- administration (Knackstedt et al, 2010a). We have also shown that Ceftriaxone attenuates cue- and cocaine- primed reinstatement while restoring levels of both xCT and GLT-1 in the nucleus accumbens core (Knackstedt  et al, 2010a). Furthermore, the protective effect of Ceftriaxone against relapse lasts for weeks following the last  administration of Ceftriaxone (Sondheimer & Knackstedt, 2011).  While Ceftriaxone shows preclinical promise  as a medication for the treatment of cocaine addiction in humans, it possesses several characteristics that may  prevent it from translating from the bench to the clinic. As an antibiotic, it possesses antimicrobial activity and  thus chronic use of
ceftriaxone can induce resistant strains of bacteria. At the high doses required to achieve  therapeutically  meaningful  CNS  concentrations  (due  to  Ceftriaxone's  low  brain  bioavailability),  chronic  Ceftriaxone  will  likely  produce  undesirable  side  effects  such  a  diarrhea.  Additionally,  Ceftriaxone  requires  parenteral  infusion  and  it  is  unlikely  that 
cocaine  dependent-patients  would  comply  with  daily  intravenous  administration  of  Ceftriaxone.    We  have  recently  identified  MC-100093,  a  lead  molecule  from  a  series  of 
monocyclic  azetadinones,  as  a  potent  up-regulator  of  GLT-1  expression  that  is  orally  bioavailable,  brain  penetrant, and induces GLT-1 up-regulation in an accepted model of cocaine addiction and withdrawal.  This  proposal  aims  to  further  optimize  the  chemical  scaffold  represented  by  MC-100093  using  a  well-defined  screening  scheme  and  a  multidimensional  approach  to  arrive  at  one  or  more  advanced  lead  molecules  that  can be advanced to IND-enabling studies.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drugs  that  effectively  treat  cocaine  addiction  and  cocaine  withdrawal  represent  a  significant  unmet  medical  need.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and most deadly primary malignant brain tumor. Despite the most
advanced treatment with combinations of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, GBM is associated with a
median life expectancy of only ~15 months. Targeted molecular therapies are arguably one of the most
promising approaches to achieving more effective future GBM therapies. A major challenge facing such an
approach is the simultaneous deregulation of multiple molecules in any given single tumor, as demonstrated by
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other published research. Because of this co-deregulation, it is not
surprising that molecular monotherapies have failed to achieve significant improvements in GBM clinical
outcomes. Several lines of evidence suggest that the simultaneous targeting of multiple deregulated molecules
and pathways is required to achieve better therapies. Based on preliminary evidence, we hypothesize that
there exist “master regulatory microRNAs” (miRNAs) that simultaneously regulate multiple
deregulated molecules in GBM. The goal of this application is to discover, investigate, and
therapeutically exploit such miRNAs. We believe that studying them will provide new information on the
mechanisms of gene expression (de)regulation in GBM and that restoring or inhibiting them can be exploited
for therapy. We propose three specific aims. In aim 1, we will use a novel screening approach, PAR-CLIP, in
combination with smRNA-seq and TCGA gene expression data analysis to uncover global miRNA targets and
identify single miRNAs (designated master regulatory miRNAs) that simultaneously target and regulate the
largest number of deregulated molecules in GBM. In aim 2, we will investigate the functions and modes of
action of these master regulatory miRNAs and validate their expressions and targets in human GBM
specimens. In aim 3, we will test miRNAs as novel experimental therapeutic agents or targets in GBM.
Thereby, we will develop and use novel potentially clinically applicable local and systemic delivery agents and
approaches including brain penetrating nanoparticles (BPN), convection-enhanced delivery (CED) and focused
ultrasound with microbubbles (FUS-MB). Successful completion of the proposed studies would establish the
first compendium of miRNA targets in GBM, generate new knowledge on the (de)regulation of gene
expression by miRNAs and their effects on GBM malignancy, and develop novel technologies for the
exploitation of novel master regulatory miRNAs in GBM therapy.","NARRATIVE
Glioblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor and one of the deadliest human cancers. One of the most
promising approaches for glioblastoma therapy is the targeting of deregulated molecules that drive tumor
malignancy. However, it has been shown that several molecules are simultaneously deregulated in any given single
tumor. Targeting them altogether with pharmacological drugs is extremely difficult because many molecules have no
known drugs and because combining several drugs leads to high toxicity. To overcome this problem, we propose to
use a new class of naturally occurring nucleic acids called microRNAs that can target several molecules at the same
time. We propose to identify such molecules, study their mechanisms of action and effects, and test them as new
experimental therapeutic drugs. If successful, these studies will improve our understanding of the molecular
mechanisms of glioblastoma and lead to the development of new and more efficient therapies.","3' Untranslated Regions; base; Binding; Bioinformatics; Brain; Cells; chemotherapy; Clinical; clinical application; Collaborations; Complex; Convection; conventional therapy; crosslink; Data; Data Analyses; Databases; Development; effective therapy; experimental study; Focused Ultrasound; Future; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Regulation; Genes; Glioblastoma; Goals; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Human; Immunoprecipitation; improved; Investigational Therapies; Knowledge; Lead; Life Expectancy; Malignant neoplasm of brain; Malignant Neoplasms; Measures; Mediating; Messenger RNA; Microbubbles; MicroRNAs; Molecular; molecular targeted therapies; mRNA Transcript Degradation; nanomedicine; nanoparticle; new technology; novel; novel strategies; Nucleic Acids; Oncogenic; Operative Surgical Procedures; Outcome; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacology; Price; Proteins; Publishing; Radiation therapy; Regulation; Research; Resolution; RNA; Role; screening; Specimen; Testing; The Cancer Genome Atlas; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Agents; therapeutic miRNA; Therapeutic Studies; therapeutic target; Time; Toxic effect; transcriptome; Translations; tumor; Universities; Untranslated RNA; Xenograft procedure"

Eye Determinants of Cognition (EyeDOC) Study
Rationale: Dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) pose enormous health and societal costs in our
aging US population. While cerebral neural loss is known to contribute to Alzheimer's dementia, vascular
diseases may contribute substantially to the total burden of dementia and its precursor, MCI. Small-vessel
cerebrovascular changes, which are most strongly associated with cognitive impairments, are difficult to detect
with brain imaging. However, recent technological advances in ocular coherence tomography (OCT) provide
refined measures of the microvascular pathology and neurodegeneration of retinal ganglion cells which may
provide sensitive biomarkers reflecting underlying cerebral processes.
Design: The EyeDOC study will be nested in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Neurocognitive Study
(ARIC-NCS), recruiting 1,000 participants (50% African-American) from two ARIC-NCS field sites (Jackson
MS and Washington County, MD) to take part in a comprehensive vision assessment with photographic and
OCT imaging of the retina. The EyeDOC visit will occur within 3 months of the ARIC NCS visit 6, and prior to
ARIC NCS visit 7, capitalizing on the study's extensive neurocognitive testing and longitudinal design.
Exposures: EyeDOC will contribute novel ocular measures to the rich ARIC NCS data including:
 A. Degree of neurodegeneration marked by loss/thinning of the macular ganglion cell complex [GCC]
 and the retinal nerve fiber layer [NFL] just outside the optic nerve head
 B. Degree of microvascular pathology marked by a lower macular vessel density, enlarged area of
 macular non-perfusion and lower average macular blood flow [flow index].
Outcomes: The late life cognitive outcomes available from ARIC-NCS include:
 A. Decline in global cognitive ability, executive function/processing speed, memory, and language –
 assessed using neurocognitive testing in V5, V6 and V7.
 B. Incidence of MCI, which was diagnosed in approximately 20% of the cohort in V5 and is expected to
 affect a larger percentage at V6 and V7 due to advancing age of the cohort.
Aims: We will assess the relationships of 1) retinal neurodegenerative measures with incident MCI and a
pattern of cognitive decline consistent with Alzheimer's disease and 2) retinal microvascular abnormalities
with incident MCI and a pattern of cognitive decline consistent with cerebral small vessel disease. Thus, the
primary focus will be the impact of NFL thinning on a decline in memory and the impact of reduced capillary
blood flow and non-perfusion area on a decline in executive function/processing speed.
Summary: The EyeDOC study will demonstrate the potential of retinal biomarkers to inform the etiology of
observed cognitive changes and provide a proof of concept for OCT to be used as an effective screening
tool for determining the underlying cause(s) of cognitive aging.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

"5R01AI120369-02","MECHANISMS REGULATING INNATE IMMUNE RESPONSES","ABRAHAM, CLARA","ABRAHAM, CLARA","Project Summary/Abstract
The interplay between host:microbial interactions is critical at mucosal surfaces. Dysregulation in
these interactions can lead to intestinal inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD). The recognition and response to microbes is initially mediated by pattern recognition receptors
(PRR). PRR responses lead to secretion of cytokines and cellular activation, as well as microbial
clearance. The balance between these outcomes influences susceptibility between inflammatory
diseases and infectious diseases. Our long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms mediating IBD
pathogenesis, thereby ultimately improving the management and therapy of human IBD.
Polymorphisms in the IRF5 region are associated with a wide-range of immune-mediated diseases,
included IBD. We found that IRF5 is the single most important genetic determinant of the inter-
individual variation in PRR-initiated signaling and cytokines from myeloid-derived cells across the
population; carriers of the IRF5 disease risk polymorphisms secrete high levels of cytokines in
response to a range of PRR stimuli. Despite the importance of IRF5 in regulating inter-individual
variation in human myeloid-derived PRR-induced cytokines, how IRF5 contributes to IBD
pathogenesis in vivo has not been examined (SA IC&IIC). Key to IBD pathogenesis is the ability of
myeloid cells to clear microbes; however, how IRF5 regulates clearance of both resident and
pathogenic intestinal microbes is not known (SA III). Multiple cell subsets can contribute to intestinal
immune dysregulation, and limited in vivo studies in IRF5-/- mice have also demonstrated a role for
IRF5 in T cell outcomes, with decreased Th1 differentiation in lupus model systems. However,
whether IRF5 regulates T cell outcomes in a T cell-intrinsic (SA I) or T cell-extrinsic (SA II) manner is
not known, including in intestinal tissues. We hypothesize that IRF5 will contribute to multiple
immune cell functions essential in intestinal immune homeostasis in vivo through its role in both
myeloid and T cell subsets, and that although it may contribute to inflammatory outcomes in colitis, it
is essential for regulating intestinal pathogens. We further hypothesize that IRF5 IBD-associated
polymorphisms will modulate the identified roles for IRF5 in these pertinent immune outcomes. We
will integrate studies in primary human cells with in vivo mouse studies to dissect IRF5 contributions
to IBD pathogenesis","Project Narrative

Innate mechanisms, in particular through pattern recognition receptor (PRR) pathways, are the initiating drivers of host responses to microbes. Of the 163 loci associated to IBD, a broad range of likely genes modulate host responses to PRR at many levels, and confer some of the largest genetic effect sizes observed in autoimmunity. Despite the significant discoveries in IBD-associated polymorphisms over the past few years, the functional consequences of the vast majority of these loci have yet to be identified. A central outcome of PRR activation by bacterial and viral products is induction of cytokine secretion. To a large extent, IBD is characterized by dysregulated cytokines, and modulation of cytokines plays a primary role in IBD treatment. Inter-individual variation in PRR- induced cytokine secretion influences the balance between susceptibility to infection and inflammatory diseases. We hypothesize that polymorphisms in multiple IBD-associated genes contribute to inter-individual variation in PRR-induced cytokine secretion. Systematic, well- powered studies comprehensively defining the functional alterations driven by disease- associated human variation will provide enormous insight into central mechanisms of IBD; leveraging naturally occurring human genetic variation to systematic ""perturb"" an experimental system represents a highly innovative approach for precisely defining established and novel PRR-mediated mechanisms of cytokine secretion. Therefore, we will utilize a large, well- powered cohort to screen for IBD-associated polymorphisms contributing to the variation in PRR-initiated cytokine secretion across individuals, and then define the molecular mechanisms wherein the implicated IBD-associated genes, as well as the identified polymorphisms, regulate PRR-induced cytokine secretion.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have developed a large functional screen to dissect the contributions of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-associated polymorphisms to the variation between individuals in pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-induced cytokine secretion; this provides a uniquely powerful means of determining the functional consequences of a number of IBD-associated loci. We will utilize this screen to first identify those IBD-associated polymorphisms contributing to PRR-initiated cytokines, and then dissect the mechanisms wherein both the genes and the specific polymorphisms within the genes modulate PRR-initiated cytokine secretion. Given the primary role that modulation of cytokine expression has played thus far in the treatment of IBD, we anticipate that studies focused on disease-associated polymorphisms that modulate cytokine secretion will ultimately result in the improved targeting and prioritization of new therapeutic targets for IBD.","Autoimmune Process; Autoimmunity; Automobile Driving; Cells; cohort; Crohn's disease; cytokine; Dendritic Cells; density; Development; Disease; Equilibrium; functional outcomes; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Polymorphism; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic Variation; Human; human disease; Human Genetics; Immune response; immunoregulation; improved; Individual; Infection; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; innovation; insight; inter-individual variation; knock-down; macrophage; Mediating; Microbe; Microbial Genetics; Molecular; monocyte; mycobacterial; new therapeutic target; novel; novel therapeutics; Outcome; Pathway interactions; Pattern recognition receptor; Play; Predisposition; protein expression; public health relevance; Receptor Activation; Risk; Role; Signal Pathway; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; STAT3 gene; System; Testing; Toll-like receptors; Transcript; Ulcerative Colitis; Variant; Viral"

The lack of effective therapies underscores the urgent need to identify novel therapeutic targets to treat HFpEF. A potential treatment target is abnormal ventricular filling during diastole or diastolic dysfunction due to cardiac fibrosis. While anti-fibrosis therapies hav a powerful effect on diastolic dysfunction, such therapies in humans have yielded disappointing results. Our proposal offers a novel approach to this problem by focusing on the activation of pro-fibrotic signaling downstream of transforming growth factor receptor beta (TGF<U+FFFD>by the stretch sensitive potassium channel TREK-1. Mice lacking TREK-1 develop exaggerated cardiac hypertrophy in response to pressure overload yet still maintain normal diastolic function. Our preliminary data suggest that this phenotype is explained by altered fibroblast activity and disruption of TGF<U+FFFD>ignaling. The overall objective of this proposal is to investigate how TREK-1 regulates cardiac fibrosis in response to pressure overload and to allow me to develop the skills to become an independent investigator. Our central hypothesis is that the loss of TREK-1 function attenuates cardiac fibrosis through disrupted TGF<U+FFFD>ignaling and diminished fibroblast activation. We will address this hypothesis, using the following approach: 1) we will determine how TREK-1 affects fibroblast function and differentiation using cardiac fibroblasts isolated from TREK-1 knockout mice and by utilizing a myocardial infarction model, 2) we will determine how TREK-1 affects TGF<U+FFFD>ediated signaling by biomechanical stretch using an in vitro cellular stretch model and 3) we will investigate how the loss of TREK-1 in fibroblasts affects response to cardiac injury using a conditional TREK-1 knockout mouse. The proposed experiments will generate insights into the development of diastolic dysfunction due to cardiac fibrosis and novel targets to treat HFpEF. Over next several years, I hope the following skills: 1) generation and utilization of animal models of cardiac disease, 2) molecular biology techniques, 3) methods to study cardiac mechanotransduction and 4) personnel management. These skills coupled with the data obtained during the award period will allow me to achieve my long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator focused on identifying molecular mechanisms underlying HFpEF.
